# Bankroll Growth & Recovery Framework

---

## Why a Bankroll Framework Matters

Bankroll management is the lifeline of any serious bettor. The difference between casual gamblers and disciplined, long-term winners often comes down to **unit sizing and recovery planning.** Without a plan, even sharp bettors can spiral into losses due to emotional decision-making (commonly called **“tilt”**).

This framework will teach you how to:
- Recover after a losing streak.
- Safely grow a bankroll from **$500 to $5,000** (or more).
- Use strict **unit-size rules** to avoid risk of ruin.

## 1. The Psychology of Recovery

**Downswings are inevitable.** Even winning bettors hit cold streaks. The key is avoiding **compounding mistakes**, such as increasing bet sizes to "win back" losses. The proper approach:
- Reduce unit size temporarily (e.g., from 2% to 1% of bankroll).
- Evaluate whether the losses are due to variance or flawed strategy.
- Treat every recovery period as a **marathon**, not a sprint.

## 2. Core Bankroll Rules

1. **Unit Size = 1–2% of Current Bankroll.**
   - At $500, 1 unit = $5–10 max.
2. **Never increase unit size mid-downswing.**
3. **Only scale up unit size after a 20% bankroll increase.**
   - Example: Bankroll grows to $600 → units go from $6 to $7.

## 3. Growth Stages – $500 to $5,000

We’ll break the journey into **10 stages** (each 20% increase in bankroll). Following this structure ensures **steady growth** and minimal risk.

| **Stage** | **Bankroll Target** | **1% Unit Size** | **2% Aggressive Unit Size** |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1         | $500 → $600         | $5               | $10                         |
| 2         | $600 → $720         | $6               | $12                         |
| 3         | $720 → $864         | $7               | $14                         |
| 4         | $864 → $1,037       | $8               | $16                         |
| 5         | $1,037 → $1,244     | $10              | $20                         |
| 6         | $1,244 → $1,492     | $12              | $24                         |
| 7         | $1,492 → $1,790     | $14              | $28                         |
| 8         | $1,790 → $2,148     | $17              | $34                         |
| 9         | $2,148 → $2,578     | $21              | $42                         |
| 10        | $2,578 → $5,000+    | $25+             | $50+                        |

**Note:** At each stage, **recalculate 1% and 2% unit sizes.** The compounding effect allows steady growth over time.

## 4. Recovery Plan After a Downswing

If your bankroll drops **20% or more**:
1. Cut unit size in half until back to original level.
2. Analyze losing bets — was it bad luck, bad lines, or poor discipline?
3. Only return to normal betting once variance corrects.

### Recovery Table
| **Bankroll Loss** | **Recovery Units (at 1% bet size)** |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| -10%              | 11+ units to recover                |
| -20%              | 25+ units to recover                |
| -30%              | 43+ units to recover                |
| -40%              | 67+ units to recover                |

## 5. Visualizing Growth (Bankroll Tracker)

To stay accountable, track:
- **Starting Bankroll** (Day 1).
- **Units Won/Lost per Day**.
- **ROI by Week**.
- **Stage Progression**.

**Tip:** Use Excel/Google Sheets or apps like **Betstamp** to track your growth.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways
- **Growth takes time:** Jumping from $500 to $5,000 might take **6–12 months** with disciplined 2–3% ROI per week.
- **Variance is real:** Even good bets lose 40–50% of the time. Your edge is long-term.
- **Stick to the plan:** Never increase bet sizes impulsively. Use a fixed schedule for recalculating units.
