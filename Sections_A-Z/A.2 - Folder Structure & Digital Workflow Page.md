Here’s the Recommended Folder Structure & Digital Workflow Page that will follow the Startup Toolkit page. This acts as a “command center” guide for organizing your files, spreadsheets, and betting/fantasy logs.

Recommended Folder Structure & Digital Workflow

Organization is the secret weapon of every successful fantasy player and bettor. Your models, tracking sheets, and notes are only as powerful as your ability to find and use them efficiently. Below is a folder template and workflow system designed for this book’s strategies.

1. Core Folder Setup

Create a master folder on your computer (or cloud drive) called:
Sports_Strategy_Hub

Inside it, create the following subfolders:

Sports_Strategy_Hub
│
├── 01_Fantasy
│   ├── Draft_Boards
│   ├── Rankings_Models
│   ├── Waiver_Wire_Tracking
│   ├── DFS_Lineups
│   └── Dynasty_Data
│
├── 02_Betting
│   ├── Bankroll_Tracker
│   ├── Odds_Logs
│   ├── Bet_Tickets
│   └── EV_Calculations
│
├── 03_Data_Sources
│   ├── FanGraphs_Exports
│   ├── Baseball_Savant_Statcast
│   ├── API_Data
│   └── Kaggle_Datasets
│
├── 04_Models
│   ├── Excel_Models
│   ├── Python_Scripts
│   ├── Machine_Learning
│   └── Simulations
│
├── 05_Visuals
│   ├── Dashboards
│   ├── Charts
│   └── Reports

2. Spreadsheet Essentials

You’ll need at least 3 key spreadsheets:

1. Fantasy Draft Sheet

Player rankings, projections, and category weights.

Tabs for tiered boards, auction values, and position scarcity.



2. Betting Bankroll & ROI Tracker

Log every bet (date, type, odds, stake, result, CLV).

Auto-calculate ROI and EV over time.



3. Model Outputs & Testing Sheet

Store projections from Python/Excel models.

Track how well predictions matched outcomes.

3. Digital Workflow Example

Morning Routine (10-30 minutes):

1. Pull updated stats from FanGraphs/Baseball Savant.


2. Update DFS projections in your DFS_Lineups folder.


3. Check odds movement logs in Betting > Odds_Logs.



Weekly Workflow:

Update season-long fantasy rankings every Sunday.

Run EV calculations and simulations for upcoming betting markets.

Archive last week’s DFS results into DFS_Lineups > Results.


Monthly Workflow:

Backup your entire Sports_Strategy_Hub folder to the cloud (Google Drive or Dropbox).

Review betting ROI trends and identify leaks or edges.



---

4. Cloud & Automation Setup

Cloud Sync: Use Google Drive or Dropbox to sync your entire folder system.

GitHub (Optional): Store Python scripts and version your models.

Zapier or IFTTT: Automate tasks like saving CSVs from APIs or pulling odds snapshots.



---

5. Bonus: Bookmarking Key Tools

Create a browser folder called “Sports Toolkit” and bookmark:

FanGraphs Leaderboards

Baseball Savant

FantasyPros Consensus Rankings

Action Network Live Odds

Unabated EV Calculators

Google Sheets Master Tracker

Would You Like Me to Create a Visual Diagram (Workflow Map)?

I can create a one-page infographic showing:

The folder structure visually.

A flowchart of “Daily > Weekly > Monthly” tasks.


This would make it a quick reference tool for the reader.
