🔍 Overview

In this article, we’ll answer:

✅ What is [topic]?

✅ Why does it matter in sports analytics or fantasy?

✅ How can we measure and model it?

✅ What real-world examples back it up?



---

🔑 Key Concepts

Term	Definition

[Metric 1]	What it means and why it matters
[Concept 2]	Statistical or sports-specific concept that plays a role
[Modeling]	Data modeling or predictive elements tied to the metric



---

🧮 Formula(s) and Metric Breakdown

> Provide all key equations, formulas, or logic used in evaluating the topic.



EXAMPLE_SCORE = (MetricA × 0.4) + (MetricB × 0.3) + (MetricC × 0.3)


---

📊 Data Inputs & Sources

Metric	Description	Source

K/BB Ratio	Strikeout-to-walk ratio	FanGraphs
Whiff%	Swing-and-miss percentage	Baseball Savant
CSW%	Called Strikes + Whiffs	FanGraphs



---

🧠 Statistical Context

✅ Sample Size Requirements
e.g., “Stabilizes after ~50 PAs”

✅ Correlation with Success Metrics
(link to studies or xERA/SIERA correlation)

✅ Machine Learning Application
(Feature importance ranking, regression R², clustering value, etc.)



---

📈 Real-World Examples

📌 Example 1 – [Player Name, Year]

- MetricA: Value
- MetricB: Value
- MetricC: Value
- Model Output: SCORE → Tier
- Interpretation: What this tells us

📌 Example 2 – Historical Trend Comparison

Visuals or bullet points:

Before Rule Change vs. After

Year-over-year comp

Pre/Post Injury or Role Shift

Column Setup:

Column	Header

A	Player Name
B	[Stat 1]
C	[Stat 2]
D	[Stat 3]
E	Final Score
F	Tier Rating


Formula Example (Cell E2):

=(B2*0.4)+(C2*0.3)+(D2*0.3)

Tier Label (Cell F2):

=IF(E2>=80,"🔥 Elite",IF(E2>=65,"🟢 Great",IF(E2>=50,"🟡 Average","🔻 Concerning")))

🧠 Interpretation Patterns

Stat Pattern	Suggests

High MetricA, Low MetricB	Raw tools, poor application
Low MetricC, High Final Score	Smart, under-the-radar success
Consistent MetricA+B Changes	Role evolution or usage spike
