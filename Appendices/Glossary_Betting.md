# Glossary – Betting Specific Formulas and Metrics

## **A**

**Arbitrage (Arb Betting)**  
A strategy where you bet all outcomes of a game at different sportsbooks to guarantee a profit, exploiting line discrepancies.

---

## **B**

**Bankroll Management**  
The strategy of dividing your total betting money (bankroll) into “units” (1–3% per bet) to avoid going broke.

**Betting Unit**  
A standardized fraction of your bankroll. For example, if you have $1,000 and use 2% units, one unit = $20.

---

## **C**

**Closing Line Value (CLV)**  
A measure of whether you beat the market by getting better odds than the closing line.  
*Example:* If you bet -2.5 (-110) and the line closes at -3.5 (-110), you’ve captured CLV.

**Cover**  
When a team beats the point spread (e.g., a -7 favorite wins by 8 or more).

**Correlation**  
In betting, when two bets are related (e.g., parlaying QB passing yards over with WR receiving yards over).

---

## **E**

**Expected Value (EV)**  
The long-term profit/loss expectation of a bet.  
\[
EV = (P \times Payout) - (1 - P) \times Risk
\]  
Where **P** = probability of winning.

---

## **H**

**Hedge**  
Placing a bet on the opposite side of your original wager to guarantee profit or reduce risk.

**Hold Percentage**  
The built-in profit margin for a sportsbook across all lines in a market.

---

## **K**

**Kelly Criterion**  
A bankroll management formula that optimizes bet size based on edge and odds:  
\[
f = \frac{bp - q}{b}
\]  
Where:
- **b** = decimal odds minus 1  
- **p** = probability of winning  
- **q** = 1 - p
