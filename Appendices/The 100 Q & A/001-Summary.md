### 🎯 Why Consistency > Ceiling (Sometimes)

In fantasy baseball—especially leagues with **weekly lineups**—we often overvalue home runs and hot streaks, while undervaluing players who deliver **steady production every week**. What if we had a tool that rewarded hitters for being dependable?

Enter the **Consistency Index (CI)** — a simple but powerful stat that helps you rank hitters not by total points, but by **how evenly those points are distributed week to week.**

---

### 🧠 What Is the Consistency Index?

It’s a statistical ratio that compares a player’s average fantasy points per week to how volatile those points are over time:

```text
Consistency Index = Mean Fantasy Points / Standard Deviation
```

* High CI = Reliable every week
* Low CI = Boom-or-bust (fun... but dangerous)

---

### 🔢 What Data Do You Need?

To calculate it, just gather:

* Weekly fantasy points (Fantrax/Yahoo exports, or FanGraphs game logs)
* Plate appearances (to remove short or injury-affected weeks)
* \[Optional] HRs, OBP, positional tags

You can use **Google Sheets** or a **Python script** to run the calculations.

### 📈 What Does It Show?

You’ll end up with a sortable list like:

| Player          | Avg Pts | StDev | CI   | Tier      |
| --------------- | ------- | ----- | ---- | --------- |
| Freddie Freeman | 18.1    | 5.2   | 3.48 | 🟩 Elite  |
| Marcus Semien   | 16.9    | 5.7   | 2.96 | 🟨 Strong |
| Nolan Gorman    | 12.4    | 8.9   | 1.39 | 🟥 Risky  |

You can build **tiers** like:

* CI > 2.5 → Elite Consistency
* CI 2.0–2.49 → Strong
* CI 1.5–1.99 → Matchup-Only
* CI < 1.0 → Avoid in Weekly Formats

---

### 🛠️ Bonus Add-Ons

* Use rolling CI (last 4 weeks) to identify trending hitters
* Cross-check with injury weeks and low-PA games
* Compare with boom metrics like HR/FB% to see *safe vs. explosive* profiles

---

### 💡 Why It’s Useful

Fantasy is a game of matchups and predictability. The Consistency Index:

* Helps you win tight matchups in head-to-head formats
* Reduces roster frustration from high-variance players
* Lets you build a team around *trustworthy floor producers*
