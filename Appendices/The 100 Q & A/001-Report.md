## üéØ The Hidden Edge in Consistency

In fantasy baseball, we often chase ceiling: 40-HR power, 30-steal upside, breakout rookies. But in weekly formats‚Äîespecially those with lineup locks or limited pickups‚Äîwhat often wins isn't explosion. It's **reliability**.

The question then becomes: how do we **measure consistency** in a meaningful, quantifiable way?
How do we reward players who give you **6‚Äì12 points every single week**, even if they never have a 30-point outburst?

That‚Äôs what this project answers. By creating a **Consistency Index (CI)** from weekly fantasy performance, we gain a powerful new tool for projecting stability and removing frustration from roster decisions.

---

## üß† What Are We Really Asking?

Let‚Äôs define what consistency actually means in a fantasy context:

* **Week-to-week performance stability**
* **Avoidance of extreme lows**
* **Trustworthiness in start/sit decisions**

We‚Äôre not looking for ‚Äúhigh average points per game.‚Äù We‚Äôre looking for **low variance** around that average. A player who scores 12, 13, 14, 12 is more valuable in certain formats than one who posts 3, 0, 25, 5.

So how do we model that?

---

## üßÆ Enter: The Consistency Index (CI)

This stat adapts the **coefficient of variation**‚Äîa classic statistical measure of dispersion‚Äîand flips it:

```
Consistency Index (CI) = Mean Weekly Fantasy Points / Standard Deviation
```

This rewards players whose scoring is tightly clustered around their average. It penalizes boom-or-bust performers whose fantasy value fluctuates wildly.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Metric (Sheets or Python)

We can calculate CI using just two things:

1. **Weekly fantasy scores**
2. **A basic formula for mean and standard deviation**

### ‚úÖ In Google Sheets

```excel
=AVERAGE(B2:O2)       ‚Üê mean weekly points  
=STDEV(B2:O2)         ‚Üê volatility  
=IF(STDEV(B2:O2)=0, 0, AVERAGE(B2:O2)/STDEV(B2:O2)) ‚Üê CI score
```

You can then sort all hitters by CI to find the **most reliable producers** in your league.

---

### ‚úÖ In Python (Pandas)

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("weekly_hitter_scores.csv")
weekly_cols = [col for col in df.columns if "Week" in col]

df["Mean"] = df[weekly_cols].mean(axis=1)
df["StDev"] = df[weekly_cols].std(axis=1)
df["CI"] = df["Mean"] / df["StDev"]

df = df[df["StDev"] > 0]  # filter out zero-variance cases
df.sort_values("CI", ascending=False).head(20)
```

This gives you a ranked list of hitters sorted by their **statistical trustworthiness**.

---

## üìä What the Output Tells Us

Let‚Äôs look at what CI can reveal. Imagine this snapshot:

| Player            | Avg Pts | StDev | CI   | Notes              |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----- | ---- | ------------------ |
| Marcus Semien     | 16.2    | 5.1   | 3.17 | High-floor machine |
| Luis Arraez       | 14.1    | 4.9   | 2.88 | Rare batting floor |
| Giancarlo Stanton | 15.0    | 11.0  | 1.36 | Boom-bust profile  |

Here, Semien is the ideal **"set it and forget it"** bat in a weekly league. Stanton, by contrast, could win you one week and lose you the next.

That difference *matters* in formats where stability is king.

---

## üß© Expanding the Model

Once you‚Äôve built the base CI metric, the possibilities are endless:

* Add **rolling 4-week CI** to track **recent trends**
* Compare **CI vs. OBP, HRs, or K%** to find efficient high-floor contributors
* Segment by **position** to find reliable 2Bs or catchers
* Remove **injury weeks** using PA thresholds
* Visualize with **heatmaps, bar charts, or volatility graphs**

Want to go deeper? Add **z-score volatility bands** and filter hitters whose worst weeks fall within one standard deviation of the mean. That tells you who never completely disappears.

---

## üîç Why It Works in Fantasy Strategy

* In **points leagues**, consistent hitters can rack up silent production
* In **H2H matchups**, they stabilize lineups when stars underperform
* In **best ball**, CI helps target floor picks to anchor roster spikes
* In **trades**, they‚Äôre often undervalued despite high reliability

This is especially true early in the season or during **fantasy playoff runs**, when *avoiding a zero* can be more important than chasing a homer.

---

## üèÅ Final Thoughts

Measuring consistency may not feel as sexy as projecting home runs. But it fills a strategic gap that few fantasy players talk about.

If you want to:

* Make better waiver decisions
* Draft safer middle-round bats
* Build playoff-caliber stability in your lineup

‚Ä¶then the **Consistency Index** is a stat you‚Äôll want to include in your process. It‚Äôs easy to build, versatile to expand, and immediately actionable.
