🔢 Question #: 1🎯 Question: How do we measure a hitter's consistency over a full season?🏷️ Category/Tags: ⚾ Fantasy Baseball, 🎮 Fantasy, 📈 Statistical

🔍 Problem Framing:Consistency matters more than ceiling in weekly formats. We need a metric that isolates volatility vs. reliability.

📊 Stats or Data Needed:

Weekly fantasy points per player

Standard deviation of stats (AVG, OBP, HR, R, RBI)

Plate appearances and game logs

🧠 Hypothesis or Model Concept:Create a "Consistency Index" using standard deviation / mean of fantasy points and core stats.

🛠️ Tools or Methods:Google Sheets, Python (Pandas), Z-Score trend lines

📈 Result, Output, or Visual:Table ranking top 25 most consistent hitters by week + positional breakout

📎 Notes or Follow-Up Ideas:Add injury weeks filter. Use rolling averages or EWMA smoothing.
