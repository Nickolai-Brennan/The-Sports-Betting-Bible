💯 Question 4 – What advanced metrics best reflect a pitcher’s “stuff” and how do we know they correlate with future success?

> 📊 Evaluating "stuff" is the foundation of pitching analytics. In this breakdown, we explore the core metrics that matter, the math behind scoring them, and a model that helps predict future dominance.

🔍 Understanding Pitcher “Stuff”

“Stuff” refers to a pitcher’s raw pitch quality — the movement, velocity, spin, and deception that make them difficult to hit. It’s not just velocity. Thanks to modern sabermetrics, we now quantify it better than ever.


---

🔑 Key Metrics That Define “Stuff”

Metric	Why It Matters	Source

Stuff+	Full pitch arsenal effectiveness index (100 = avg)	FanGraphs
CSW%	Shows how often a pitcher gets called strikes or whiffs	FanGraphs
Spin Rate	Measures ball movement and deception	Statcast
K/BB Ratio	Balances dominance and control	FanGraphs
Whiff%	Measures swing-and-miss power	Statcast



---

📐 STUFF SCORE MODEL (Simple Formula)

This model blends key metrics into a single score:

STUFF\_SCORE = (Stuff+ × 0.35) + (CSW% × 0.25) + (Spin Rate Index × 0.15) + (K/BB × 0.15) + (Whiff% × 0.10)

Example Input:

Stuff+ = 125

CSW% = 33

Spin Index (out of 100) = 90

K/BB = 4.0

Whiff% = 34


Model Output:

STUFF\_SCORE = 43.75 + 8.25 + 13.5 + 0.6 + 3.4 = 69.5

➡️ 69.5 = Very strong “stuff” profile


---

📈 Real-World Case Study – Bryan Abreu (2023)

Stuff+: 132

CSW%: 36.8%

Spin Index: 92

K/BB: 4.2

Whiff%: 38.5%


> STUFF_SCORE = 73.68 → Elite Tier



Despite being a setup man (not a closer), Abreu’s metrics forecast long-term success and usage in high-leverage roles.

💡 Why These Metrics Predict Success

🧬 Early stabilization: Whiff%, CSW% and K/BB stabilize after ~50–100 batters faced.

🧠 Strong correlation: These metrics feed into xERA, SIERA, and FIP-based predictors.

🤖 ML models: Data science studies show these are top features in pitcher performance modeling (example).

🛠️ Spreadsheet Walkthrough – Building a STUFF Score Evaluator in Google Sheets

To help you track and score pitchers' "stuff" in real time, here’s a full step-by-step guide to create your own dynamic spreadsheet.


---

📋 Step 1 – Set Up the Core Columns

In a Google Sheet, create the following column headers:

A	B	C	D	E	F	G

Player Name	Team	Stuff+	CSW%	Spin Index	K/BB	Whiff%



---

📊 Step 2 – Create the STUFF_SCORE Formula Column

In Column H, label it: Stuff Score

Use this formula inside cell H2 (adjust cell references as needed):

=(C2*0.35)+(D2*0.25)+(E2*0.15)+(F2*0.15)+(G2*0.10)```  
This blends all the input metrics using the weighted formula explained earlier.  
  
  
---  
  
📈 Step 3 – Add Conditional Formatting to Highlight Scores  
  
1. Select the entire Stuff Score column.  
  
  
2. Use Conditional Formatting in Google Sheets:  
  
Green for scores ≥ 70 (Elite)  
  
Yellow for scores 50–69 (Average to Good)  
  
Red for scores < 50 (Below-Average)  
  
  
  
  
This helps visually flag standout arms or those with issues.  
  
  
---  
  
🧪 Step 4 – Insert a Score Rating Key  
  
Below your table, insert a reference chart like this:  
  
Stuff Score	Grade	Meaning  
  
80+	🔥 Top Tier	Unhittable stuff, elite K/BB, ace-like  
70–79	🟢 Excellent	Strong arm, high-leverage usage likely  
60–69	🟡 Good	Strong but may lack elite deception  
50–59	⚠️ Average	Fringe arm, possibly inconsistent  
< 50	🔻 Concerning	Weak deception, may struggle in MLB  
  
  
  
---  
  
📎 Bonus Tips  
  
Use IMPORTXML to auto-pull Fangraphs or Baseball Savant data for advanced users.  
  
Add monthly trends by creating columns for each 30-day period (Stuff+ rolling, CSW% rolling).  
  
Insert filters or slicers to view only:  
  
Relievers vs. Starters  
  
Lefties vs. Righties  
  
Top 10 or Bottom 10 arms  
  
  
  
  
---  
  
✅ What to Watch For  
  
Symptom	Suggests  
  
High Stuff+, Low CSW%	Raw pitch quality, poor usage  
High Spin, Low K/BB	Great pitch shape, control issues  
Low Whiff%, High K/BB	Possibly overperforming  
Low Stuff+ but High CSW% & K/BB	High IQ pitcher, finesse type

Here’s your Markdown lesson for calculating pitcher "Stuff" metrics, assigning tier levels, and weighing their importance by percentage in modeling future performance:

🧮 Pitcher “Stuff” Scoring – Quick Lesson & Tiering Guide

> A practical guide to evaluating raw pitching metrics and building a predictive scoring system for fantasy or scouting use.




---

📊 Step 1 – Collect the Key Stats

Metric	Description	Source

Stuff+	Measures total pitch arsenal quality (100=avg)	FanGraphs
CSW%	Called Strikes + Whiff %	FanGraphs
Spin Index	Scaled 0–100 spin efficiency score	Statcast
K/BB	Strikeouts per Walk ratio	FanGraphs
Whiff%	Percentage of swings that miss	Statcast



---

🧠 Step 2 – Assign Weight of Importance

These weights represent the predictive value of each stat in modeling future success:

Metric	Weight (%)	Why It’s Important

Stuff+	35%	Best composite index of "stuff"
CSW%	25%	Combines deception + command
Spin Index	15%	Influences movement + whiffs
K/BB	15%	Measures dominance & control
Whiff%	10%	Swing-and-miss power



---

🧮 Step 3 – Use the STUFF_SCORE Formula

STUFF_SCORE = (Stuff+ × 0.35) + (CSW% × 0.25) + (Spin Index × 0.15) + (K/BB × 0.15) + (Whiff% × 0.10)

Insert your pitcher’s values to calculate the STUFF_SCORE.


---

🔢 Step 4 – Apply Tier System

Score Range	Tier	Meaning

80+	🔥 Top Tier	Unhittable stuff, elite projection
70–79	🟢 Excellent	High-leverage, closing upside
60–69	🟡 Good	Strong but not dominant
50–59	⚠️ Average	Fringe MLB/relief role possible
< 50	🔻 Concerning	Poor stuff profile, needs improvement

Here is a clean and structured breakdown of the Google Sheet setup for the Pitcher "Stuff" Scoring System:


---

📋 Sheet Columns List (Column Headers)

Column	Header	Description

A	Player Name	Name of the pitcher
B	Team	MLB team
C	Stuff+	Pitcher’s Stuff+ score (e.g. 110)
D	CSW%	Called Strikes + Whiff % (e.g. 30)
E	Spin Index	Spin rate index (0–100 scale)
F	K/BB	Strikeout-to-walk ratio (e.g. 4.2)
G	Whiff%	Whiff percentage (e.g. 32)
H	STUFF_SCORE	Final score based on weighted formula
I	Tier Level	Tier rating based on score ranges



---

🧮 Formula for STUFF_SCORE (Cell H2)

Paste this into Cell H2:

=(C2*0.35)+(D2*0.25)+(E2*0.15)+(F2*0.15)+(G2*0.10)


---

🏷️ Formula for Tier Level (Cell I2)

Paste this into Cell I2 to automatically assign a tier based on the STUFF_SCORE:

=IF(H2>=80,"🔥 Top Tier",IF(H2>=70,"🟢 Excellent",IF(H2>=60,"🟡 Good",IF(H2>=50,"⚠️ Average","🔻 Concerning"))))


---

✅ Optional Conditional Formatting

Apply color rules to STUFF_SCORE column (Column H):

Green: >= 70

Yellow: 60–69.99

Orange: 50–59.99

Red: < 50

Would you like me to generate a downloadable Google Sheet version of this or prefill some example pitchers into the table?



---

🧪 Example Calculation

Pitcher X:

Stuff+ = 120

CSW% = 32

Spin Index = 85

K/BB = 4.5

Whiff% = 33


STUFF_SCORE =
(120 × 0.35) + (32 × 0.25) + (85 × 0.15) + (4.5 × 0.15) + (33 × 0.10)
= 42 + 8 + 12.75 + 0.675 + 3.3 = 66.725 → Tier = 🟡 Good


---

✅ Final Tips

⚙️ Use Google Sheets formulas for automation

🎯 Prioritize Stuff+ and CSW% when projecting future success

📉 Flag pitchers with low K/BB or Whiff% below 25%

  
---  
  
🧠 Final Tip  
  
> “Stuff alone doesn’t make a great pitcher. The secret is understanding how it fits within command, trust, and usage.”  
  
  
  
📎 This model helps quantify that fit.
