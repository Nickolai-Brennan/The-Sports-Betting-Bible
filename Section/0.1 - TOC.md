## 📂 Section 1.2 – League Types & How They Change the Game

*Formats Define Strategy, and Strategy Defines Success*

### 1.2.1 Redraft Leagues: The Annual Reset

The most common format — draft fresh, play hard, reset yearly. Strategy hinges on prep, pickups, and short-term thinking.

### 1.2.2 Dynasty Leagues: The GM Simulator

Long-term roster building across seasons. Prioritizes age, draft capital, and multiyear trade logic.

### 1.2.3 Keeper Leagues: The Middle Ground

Keep a few players each year. Blends redraft fun with long-term value hunting.

### 1.2.4 Head-to-Head Leagues (H2H)

Weekly matchups, playoff brackets, and volatility. Strategy shifts week to week based on opponent and matchups.

### 1.2.5 Rotisserie (Roto) Leagues

Category-based cumulative scoring. Emphasizes balance and long-view roster construction.

### 1.2.6 Points Leagues

Points per stat with no categories. Prioritizes volume, projection models, and raw scoring efficiency.

### 1.2.7 Best Ball Leagues

No waivers or lineup changes. Just draft, optimize, and hope your bench explodes when needed.

### 1.2.8 Superflex & 2QB Leagues

Quarterbacks matter more. Demand for early QB value and depth completely reshapes draft strategy.

### 1.2.9 IDP (Individual Defensive Player) Leagues

Defense joins the fantasy equation. Tackles, sacks, and INTs matter — and the scoring settings drive everything.

### 1.2.10 Combo & Custom Leagues

Wild west formats that mix elements: contracts, multiple sports, unique playoffs. High complexity = high edge.
