## 1.6.1 – Fantasy Platforms Overview

Fantasy platforms are the digital ecosystems where leagues are hosted, players are managed, and the game is played. While the core fantasy mechanics remain relatively similar, each platform comes with unique features, scoring engines, interface strengths, and customization options.

Choosing the right platform is the foundation for a smooth season. It influences how easy it is to draft, trade, manage lineups, communicate with your league, and even how stats are interpreted.
