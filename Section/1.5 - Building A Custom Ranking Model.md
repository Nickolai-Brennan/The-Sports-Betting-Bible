# 📊 1.5 – Building a Custom Ranking Model

## 1.5.0 - Introduction


Where Subjectivity Ends and Structure Begins

Fantasy managers often walk into their drafts clutching a cheat sheet printed from some expert’s site—usually a consensus ranking based on average projections. But here’s the hard truth: average advice builds average teams. If your league has unique scoring, custom rosters, or even just idiosyncratic opponents, then using a generic ranking list is like bringing a butter knife to a swordfight.

This chapter is about sharpening your edge. We're going to build a model—a systematic, numbers-first way to evaluate fantasy players that can be tuned to any format. Not only will this give you league-specific insights, but it will also remove the emotion, hype, and groupthink that cloud most decisions.

> “In God we trust. All others bring data.”
—W. Edwards Deming



A custom ranking model helps you assign real value to each player based on your league’s exact rules and roster configuration. Is your league PPR? Do quarterbacks get six points per touchdown? Do saves matter more than ERA? Your model accounts for that. Rather than blindly trusting ADP (Average Draft Position), you’ll build a ranking system that reflects true performance potential within your strategic context.

This isn’t just for advanced players. The methodology we’ll lay out uses basic tools: spreadsheets, projections, and a bit of math. You don’t need to know Python or machine learning. You just need to understand the fundamentals of how value is calculated—and how it can be distorted by format, risk, or positional scarcity.

Here’s what you’ll walk away with:

A personal ranking sheet that beats consensus lists.

Tiering logic that prevents panic picks.

VORP (Value Over Replacement Player) logic tailored to your format.

Methods for weighing volatility, injury risk, and upside properly.

Dynamic draft boards that evolve as projections shift.


In today’s meta, information is abundant, but insight is rare. This section bridges that gap by showing you how to turn raw data into draft-day confidence. Whether you’re a redraft purist, a dynasty builder, or a DFS optimizer, the tools in this chapter will elevate your game.

We’ll also cover how to adapt your model over time: tweaking inputs, adjusting scoring weights, and preparing for in-season player evaluations. Even if you’re not ready to abandon expert rankings completely, building your own model will expose inefficiencies in theirs.

Fantasy isn’t just about who scores the most—it’s about who scores the most relative to opportunity, scarcity, and context. That’s what this model uncovers.

Next: we break down what inputs you need to begin — projections, scoring settings, depth charts, and the building blocks of your custom engine.


---

## 1.5.1 – Defining Your Ranking Goals (Fantasy Baseball)

Before you can build a custom ranking model, you need to decide what you’re optimizing for. Fantasy baseball offers multiple formats—**Roto**, **Points**, **H2H Categories**, and **Best Ball**—and each rewards different statistical profiles. Your model must reflect your league’s structure, competitive landscape, and tolerance for risk.

### 🎯 Step 1: Match Format to Objective

| Format         | Goal                          | Implication                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Roto           | Balance across all categories | Avoid punting stats; weigh SBs/Saves higher |
| Points League  | Maximize projected points     | Volume matters; OBP > AVG                |
| H2H Categories | Weekly category wins          | Streaks + schedule impact rankings       |
| Best Ball      | Maximize spike weeks          | Prioritize volatility + ceiling          |

### 🧠 Example Use Case

If you’re in a 12-team **Roto** league using 5x5 scoring (AVG, HR, RBI, R, SB / W, ERA, WHIP, K, SV), your model needs to generate category-specific value projections. For instance, a player with moderate power but elite SB potential (like Esteury Ruiz) might rank higher than a pure slugger with no speed in this context.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Define Replacement Level

To calculate value over baseline, establish **replacement-level performance** for each position and stat category. This varies by format and league depth.

#### Example Replacement-Level Table (Roto, 12-team)

| Position | Replacement-Level Stats (Season Avg) |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| C        | 15 HR, 55 RBI, .235 AVG               |
| 1B       | 22 HR, 70 RBI, .250 AVG               |
| SS       | 12 HR, 20 SB, .260 AVG                |
| SP       | 150 IP, 8.5 K/9, 4.25 ERA             |
| RP       | 18 Saves, 3.60 ERA, 1.25 WHIP         |

You’ll use this table to calculate **Value Over Replacement (VORP)** in your model.

---

### 📈 Step 3: Choose Your Output

Decide whether your model will output:

- **Raw Projected Stats** per player
- **Category-weighted scores** (for Roto)
- **Overall Rankings**
- **Tiered Value Buckets**

The more detailed the output, the more complex your logic—but also the more customizable your draft approach.

---

### 📊 Formula Preview

To guide your ranking model, your base formula may look like this:

```
`VORP = Player Stat – Replacement Stat`
```

Later subsections will expand this to include z-scores, weighted category multipliers, and scoring-based projection adjustments.

---

## 1.5.2 – Gathering Player Projections & Stat Inputs (Fantasy Baseball)

A ranking model is only as good as the data that powers it. In this section, we’ll walk through where to get projections, what types of stats matter, and how to structure your inputs for modeling purposes.

---

### 📥 Step 1: Choose Your Projection Sources

High-quality projections come in many flavors. Most fantasy baseball models are built on publicly available or subscription-based datasets.

| Source         | Type         | Notes                                      |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| FanGraphs (Depth Charts, Steamer) | Season-long projections | Free; CSV exportable; widely used |
| Baseball Prospectus (PECOTA) | Advanced projections     | Paid; includes aging curves and comps |
| Razzball          | Fantasy-specific stats  | Includes auction values and $ estimates |
| THE BAT (by Derek Carty) | DFS & Season-long      | Highly accurate; available on Fangraphs or Rotogrinders |
| Rotowire / CBS / ESPN | Platform rankings       | Useful for ADP comparison, not modeling |

> 🧠 Tip: Use multiple sources and average them to reduce bias.

---

### 🧮 Step 2: Define Key Stats by Format

For **Roto leagues**, the 5x5 standard (HR, R, RBI, SB, AVG / W, K, ERA, WHIP, SV) is the core. But even within those, some stats are more predictable and modelable than others.

#### 🧾 Suggested Stat Inputs for Hitters:

- HR, R, RBI, SB
- AVG (or OBP if used)
- PA (plate appearances) – for volume scaling

#### 🧾 Suggested Stat Inputs for Pitchers:

- IP (innings pitched)
- K, W, SV
- ERA, WHIP
- K/9, BB/9, HR/9 (advanced projection sanity checks)

---

### 🗂️ Step 3: Organize Your Input Sheet

All data should be cleaned and consistently formatted. Start with a Google Sheet or Excel workbook structured like this:

| Player Name | Team | Pos | PA | HR | R | RBI | SB | AVG | W | SV | K | ERA | WHIP |
|-------------|------|-----|----|----|---|-----|----|-----|---|----|---|-----|------|
| Juan Soto   | NYY  | OF  | 650| 32 | 96| 90  | 8  | .295| — | —  | — | —   | —    |
| Spencer Strider | ATL | SP | —  | —  | — | —   | —  | —   | 16| 0  | 240| 3.20| 1.10 |

> 📦 Create separate tabs for hitters and pitchers.

---

### 🔁 Optional: Add Historical Data

Overlay 1–2 years of actual player stats to compare projections with past performance. This improves model validation and lets you spot outliers or injury recoveries.

| Player | Year | HR | RBI | AVG | K | IP | ERA |
|--------|------|----|-----|-----|---|----|-----|
| Soto   | 2023 | 35 | 109 | .290| — | —  | —   |
| Strider| 2023 | —  | —   | —   | 281| 186| 3.86|

---

### ✅ Summary

Gathering clean, positionally-diverse, and format-specific projections is the backbone of any fantasy baseball model. The quality of your rankings starts with how reliable and relevant your inputs are.

---

### 1.5.3 – Sourcing and Cleaning Baseball Data

Accurate rankings start with quality inputs. Before modeling, data must be **sourced, verified, and cleaned**. Dirty or inconsistent inputs will degrade projection quality and introduce bias into rankings.

---

#### 🗂️ Step 1: Identify Reliable Data Sources

You’ll need multiple stat feeds to build a comprehensive model. Some of the most used platforms for fantasy baseball data include:

| Source            | Data Provided                                          | Use Case                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| FanGraphs         | Advanced metrics (wOBA, xFIP, K-BB%, BABIP)            | Projection calibration, regression inputs|
| Baseball Savant   | Statcast data (Exit Velo, Launch Angle, Barrel%)      | Quality of contact, aging curves         |
| Baseball Reference| Historical and seasonal player stats                   | Consistency trends, park factors         |
| Rotowire / RotoBaller | Player news, injuries, depth charts              | Context adjustments, injury discounts    |
| FantasyPros       | ADP, ECR (Expert Consensus Rankings)                  | Market value mapping                     |

---

#### 🧹 Step 2: Clean and Normalize the Data

Once sourced, all datasets must be standardized. This includes formatting columns, handling missing values, and ensuring uniform naming conventions.

**Cleaning Checklist:**
- Ensure all players are referenced using a unified naming schema (e.g., full name, team, position)
- Standardize units (e.g., converting innings pitched into decimal format)
- Remove players with <50 ABs or <10 IP (unless prospect stashing)
- Handle missing fields with defaults or regression fill-ins
- Confirm statistical ranges are within logical bounds (e.g., BABIP between .200–.400)

**Normalization Techniques:**
- Scale stats like HR or SB per 600 PA for batters or per 180 IP for pitchers
- Convert counting stats to rates for better comparison (e.g., HR/PA, K/9)
- Use Z-scores or Min-Max scaling to align metric scales for multi-factor models

---

#### 🔀 Step 3: Merge Data into a Master Sheet

To build a functional model, create a unified spreadsheet or database that includes all relevant metrics for each player.

**Recommended Columns for Hitters:**
- Player Name
- Team
- Position
- PA (Plate Appearances)
- AVG / OBP / SLG / wOBA
- HR / SB / RBI / R / BB%
- Statcast metrics (Barrel%, EV, Launch Angle)

**Recommended Columns for Pitchers:**
- Player Name
- Team
- IP (Innings Pitched)
- ERA / WHIP / K% / BB% / xFIP / BABIP
- SwStr%, GB%, HR/FB
- Velocity, Pitch Mix (if available)

---

#### 🔗 Final Output

The result of this step is a **clean master dataset** that serves as the foundation for projection modeling and ranking calculations.

You can now feed this into Excel, R, Python, or Google Sheets, depending on your modeling preference.

---

### 1.5.4 – Selecting and Weighting Performance Metrics (Expanded)

To build a robust and accurate fantasy baseball ranking model, the core lies in selecting **relevant metrics** and assigning **smart weights**. These define how your model interprets player performance. This deeper dive outlines not just what to include, but how to structure, weight, and normalize these inputs.

---

#### 🧠 Why Weighting Matters

Fantasy leagues award value differently depending on format. A stolen base in roto might be worth as much as a home run due to category scarcity. In contrast, in a points league, the HR may outscore a SB 4:1. Without correct weighting, your rankings will fail to reflect true in-league value.

---

#### 🔎 Selecting Stats: Foundation vs. Flavor

**Foundation metrics** are core stats that correlate highly with fantasy scoring (e.g., HR, K, OBP). **Flavor metrics** are supplemental—often advanced—used to adjust for sustainability or hidden value (e.g., Barrel%, BABIP, SwStr%).

##### Example – Hitters:

| Category   | Stat         | Why It Matters                                      |
|------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Power      | HR, ISO      | Direct fantasy value, signals raw slugging         |
| Plate Disc.| BB%, K%      | Determines OBP, floor, upside stability             |
| Contact    | AVG, BABIP   | Measures consistency and possible regression        |
| Speed      | SB, BsR      | Scarce stat; BsR signals base-stealing capability   |
| Advanced   | wOBA, xwOBA  | Captures overall offensive contribution             |
| Quality    | Barrel%, EV  | Indicates power sustainability and breakout risk    |

##### Example – Pitchers:

| Category     | Stat        | Why It Matters                                      |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Dominance    | K/9, K%     | Strikeouts = fantasy points, category wins          |
| Efficiency   | BB/9, K-BB% | Reflects command; core predictor of ERA             |
| Run Control  | ERA, xERA   | Actual vs. expected run prevention                  |
| Contact Mgt. | WHIP, HR/9  | WHIP = category win; HRs penalize in points leagues |
| Swing Stuff  | CSW%, SwStr%| Indicates future strikeout potential                |

---

#### ⚖️ Assigning Weights: Methods

##### 1. **Subjective Scaling (Roto)**
Assign weights based on:
- Category scarcity
- Category volatility
- Correlation to league standings

Example for Hitters in 5x5 Roto:

| Metric | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| HR     | 0.25   |
| AVG    | 0.20   |
| R      | 0.15   |
| RBI    | 0.20   |
| SB     | 0.20   |

> 📌 *Note:* SB might get a 25% weight in leagues where speed is scarce.

##### 2. **Scoring-Based Weights (Points League)**
Mirror platform scoring (Fantrax, Yahoo, ESPN).

Example for Pitchers (Fantrax Points):

| Metric | League Value | Weight |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| IP     | 3 pts/IP     | 0.25   |
| K      | 1 pt/K       | 0.20   |
| ER     | -1 pt/ER     | -0.15  |
| BB     | -0.5 pt/BB   | -0.10  |
| W      | 6 pts/W      | 0.15   |
| QS     | 3 pts/QS     | 0.15   |

---

#### 📏 Normalization Techniques

Metrics with different units (e.g., AVG vs. HR) must be normalized before combining. Two options:

##### Method 1: **Z-Score**

```
Z = (Player Stat – Mean Stat) / Standard Deviation
```

- Centers data around 0
- Highlights outliers
- Ideal for multi-metric synthesis

##### Method 2: **Min-Max Scaling**

```
Scaled = (Value – Min) / (Max – Min)
```

- Range 0–1
- Easy for weighting and visualization
- Preserves original distribution shape

> ⚠️ Use the same method for all metrics in the model to avoid distortion.

---

#### 🧮 Final Output Formula (Generic)

```
Weighted Score = Σ (Normalized Stat × Assigned Weight)
```

Example for a hitter:

★
```
Weighted Score = (Z_HR × 0.25) + (Z_AVG × 0.20) + (Z_R × 0.15) + (Z_RBI × 0.20) + (Z_SB × 0.20)
```

---

#### 🛠 Implementation Tip

Organize each player as a row in a spreadsheet or database. Assign columns for:
- Raw stats
- Normalized stats
- Weighted metrics
- Final score

You’ll use this final score in **1.5.5** to rank and sort players.

## 1.5.5 – Calculating Weighted Fantasy Scores

### ⚖️ Why Weighting Matters
Not all stats are created equal. In fantasy baseball, home runs, stolen bases, batting average, and RBIs all contribute differently to league scoring and player valuation. To reflect this, we assign a weight to each category based on its relevance and scarcity.

This subsection explains how to calculate a composite fantasy score for each player using a weighted model.

---

### 📊 Step-by-Step: Weighting Fantasy Categories

#### 1. **Normalize Each Stat**
Normalization lets us compare different stats (like HR vs. SB) on the same scale.

**Option A: Z-Score Normalization**
```
Z = (X - μ) / σ
```
Where:
- `X` = Player stat
- `μ` = League average
- `σ` = Standard deviation

**Option B: Min-Max Scaling**
```
Scaled = (X - Min) / (Max - Min)
```
This maps all stat values between 0 and 1.

---

#### 2. **Assign Weights to Each Category**
Example weights (customizable per league):
- HR = 25%
- R = 20%
- RBI = 20%
- SB = 15%
- AVG = 20%

---

#### 3. **Calculate Weighted Value**
```
Weighted Value = Scaled Stat × Weight
```
Do this for each stat category per player.

---

#### 4. **Sum All Weighted Values**
```
Total Score = Sum of All Weighted Values
```
This gives you a composite value you can use to rank players.

---

### 📘 Variable & Statistic Glossary

### 📈 Fantasy Baseball Stat Categories (Examples)

#### Hitters
| **Stat** | **Meaning** | **Notes** |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| HR       | Home Runs | Power metric; high fantasy impact |
| R        | Runs Scored | Context-dependent on lineup spot |
| RBI      | Runs Batted In | Also lineup-dependent |
| SB       | Stolen Bases | Scarce stat in modern baseball |
| AVG      | Batting Average (Hits ÷ ABs) | Traditional stat; can be replaced with OBP in some leagues |
| OBP      | On-Base Percentage | More predictive than AVG in points/advanced leagues |

#### Pitchers *(used in parallel systems)*
| **Stat** | **Meaning** | **Notes** |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| K        | Strikeouts | Common scoring metric |
| ERA      | Earned Run Average | Lower is better |
| WHIP     | Walks + Hits per Inning Pitched | Efficiency indicator |
| QS       | Quality Starts | Alternative to Wins in modern formats |
| SV       | Saves | Valued in 5x5 roto or category leagues |
| HLD      | Holds | Used in leagues with setup men scoring |

---

### 🧠 Strategy Tip
Use the right **normalization method** for your model:
- Use **Z-score** when comparing across diverse stat distributions.
- Use **Min-Max scaling** when targeting percentile visuals or dashboard-friendly scores.

## 1.5.6 – Weighted Composite Scoring: Turning Data into Draft Grades (Expanded)

Once you've calculated standardized scores (Z-scores or scaled stats), the next major step in your ranking model is to translate those numbers into actionable draft intelligence. A weighted composite score gives you one number per player — factoring in every stat you care about, in proportion to how much you care.

This section dives deeper into why composite scoring works, how to tailor it for different fantasy baseball formats, and how to generate a fully sortable list of draft targets based on your league's values.


---

🧩 Why Build a Weighted Score?

Most draft rankings use arbitrary or expert-based ordering. A weighted score replaces opinion with math. It offers:

Objective, reproducible rankings

Format-specific customizability

Category-agnostic player comparison

Cross-positional value mapping


This becomes essential in competitive leagues where you’re making razor-thin decisions between, say, Kyle Schwarber and Adolis García.


---

⚖️ How to Structure Your Weighted Model

Step 1: Identify Your Stat Categories

Choose the stats that drive scoring in your format. For example:

5x5 Roto: HR, RBI, R, SB, AVG

Points League: Total Bases, Walks, SB, Ks (neg), RBIs

OBP Leagues: OBP replaces AVG, and BB matters more


Your model should match the rules. If your league doesn’t use batting average, do not include AVG in your scoring.


---

Step 2: Choose a Normalization Method

Use Z-scores or Min-Max scaling to convert raw stats into comparable values:

Z-score formula:

Z = (X – μ) / σ

Where:

X = player’s raw stat

μ = average stat in the dataset

σ = standard deviation


Z-scores allow for:

Easy comparison across different stat types

Identification of players who excel (Z > 1) or trail (Z < 0)



---

Step 3: Assign Weights to Each Stat

Weights reflect how important each stat is in your league or strategy. You might value stolen bases more if your league doesn’t have many base stealers.

Stat Category	Example Weight	Notes

HR	1.0	High fantasy impact
RBI	1.0	Core production stat
R	1.0	Runs are often underweighted
SB	1.2	Scarce and valuable
AVG or OBP	1.0	Consistency factor


> Pro tip: In Points leagues, set weights directly based on scoring values (e.g., 4 pts for HR, 1 pt per run, etc.)




---

Step 4: Calculate Weighted Score

For each stat:

Weighted Stat = Z-score × Weight

Then sum:

Total Score = Σ (Zᵢ × wᵢ)

This gives each player a unified numeric score. Sort players by this value to create your draft board.


---

📊 Example: 5x5 League Score Calculation

Player	HR (Z × w)	RBI (Z × w)	SB (Z × w)	AVG (Z × w)	R (Z × w)	Total Score

Ronald Acuña Jr.	1.3	1.2	2.5	1.0	1.6	7.6
Julio Rodríguez	1.0	0.9	2.2	0.8	1.3	6.2
Pete Alonso	2.0	1.8	-0.4	-0.2	1.1	4.3


This model shows Acuña is a top-tier contributor across all five categories. Meanwhile, Alonso’s limited contribution to SB and AVG lowers his overall profile, despite elite power.


---

🧠 Strategic Implications

Category Scarcity: Boost weights for rare stats like SB or Saves.

Team Build Strategy: If punting AVG, drop its weight to 0.

Format Sensitivity: Change inputs entirely in Points Leagues (e.g., strikeouts, walks, total bases).



---

⚙️ Advanced Enhancements

Positional Adjustments: Apply scarcity multipliers (see 1.5.7).

Percentile Scaling: Convert final scores into 0–100 scale for dashboards.

Tier Creation: Use standard deviation thresholds to label players as Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.

Dynamic Roster Filtering: Add flags for UTIL-only players or multi-position eligibility.



---

✅ Summary Table

Step	Action

1	Select stat categories from your league format
2	Normalize each player stat (Z-score or Min-Max)
3	Assign weights based on scoring or strategic value
4	Multiply each stat by its weight
5	Sum weighted stats for final composite score
6	Sort all players descending by score for your custom draft board


## 1.5.7 – Positional Adjustments and Scarcity Indexing

In fantasy baseball, not all positions offer the same depth or value. A first baseman who hits 30 home runs is valuable, but if there are 15 other 1Bs doing the same, the scarcity drops. Meanwhile, a catcher who hits 22 homers might be exponentially more valuable because of the positional gap.

This section explains how to account for positional scarcity in your custom ranking model using adjustment formulas and indexing methods.


---

📌 Why Positional Adjustments Matter

Positional depth varies — 2B and C are typically shallower than OF and 1B.

Scarcity creates positional inflation — the value of stats increases when fewer peers can produce them.

Draft value must be measured relative to the position, not just overall production.



---

🧮 Step 1: Calculate Average Positional Scores

After computing total weighted scores (from 1.5.6), group players by position and calculate:

Mean Score per Position

Standard Deviation per Position

Top N Average (e.g., average score of top 12 1Bs or top 8 C)


This provides a baseline to compare players within their own positional context.


---

🔍 Step 2: Compute Scarcity Index (SI)

Use this formula to determine scarcity:

SI = League Avg Score – Position Avg Score

Where:

League Avg Score = Average score of top X players at all positions

Position Avg Score = Average score of top Y players at one position


This tells you how far a position lags (or exceeds) the league average in scoring output.


---

📉 Example Scarcity Index (12-team league)

Position	Top N	Avg Score	SI (vs. League Avg 4.2)

C	12	2.8	1.4
2B	12	3.6	0.6
SS	12	4.0	0.2
1B	12	4.5	-0.3


> Positive SI = Scarce position (boost value)
Negative SI = Deep position (can draft late)




---

🎯 Step 3: Apply Positional Adjustment Factor

Add scarcity as a score boost to each player:

Adjusted Score = Weighted Score + SI

This ensures that scarce-position players rise in draft rankings, helping you avoid gaps in weak areas like catcher or middle infield.


---

💡 Optional: Scarcity Multiplier by Position

Alternatively, use multipliers instead of additive bonuses:

Position	Scarcity Multiplier

C	1.15
2B	1.10
SS	1.05
3B	1.00
OF	0.95


Adjusted Score = Weighted Score × Scarcity Multiplier

Choose additive vs. multiplicative based on how aggressively you want to elevate shallow positions.


---

⚠️ Caveats

Don’t overinflate bad players at scarce positions. Your ranking model should still cap total boosts.

Scarcity applies more in Roto and Redraft, less in DFS where salaries adjust dynamically.



---

✅ Summary

Step	Action

1	Calculate average scores by position
2	Determine scarcity index (SI)
3	Add SI or apply multipliers to weighted scores
4	Rerank players using adjusted scores
5	Use rankings to balance team construction across thin and deep positions


Let me know when you're ready for 1.5.8 – Visualizing Your Rankings with Tiers and Dashboards.

## 1.5.8 – Visualizing Your Rankings with Tiers and Dashboards

After calculating custom weighted scores and applying positional adjustments, your model is technically complete — but not yet usable. Raw numbers don’t win drafts; decision clarity does. That’s where visualization comes in.

This section outlines how to convert your ranked player data into tiered charts, sortable dashboards, and dynamic sheets that help you navigate a live draft room with speed and confidence.


---

📊 Why Visualization Matters

Draft pressure is real: Clear visuals prevent panic picks.

Tiers show drop-offs: Grouping similar-value players highlights positional cliffs.

Dashboards track needs: Live filtering by position, team, and stat profile keeps your roster construction on track.



---

🧱 Step 1: Tiering by Score Distribution

Use your adjusted scores from 1.5.7 to create logical tiers.

📉 How to Tier:

Step 1: Sort players by adjusted score (descending).

Step 2: Calculate standard deviation.

Step 3: Assign tiers using score bands.


> Example:

Tier 1 = Top 1–1.0 SD above mean

Tier 2 = Within 0.5–1.0 SD

Tier 3 = Within 0–0.5 SD

Tier 4 = Below mean




This method ensures statistical consistency across tiers.


---

🧩 Step 2: Build a Draft Dashboard

Use Google Sheets, Excel, or Airtable to create an interactive dashboard that includes:

Column	Data Type

Player Name	Text
Position	Dropdown
Team	Text
Adjusted Score	Numeric (color-graded)
Tier	Numeric or Label (T1–T5)
Roster Need	Checkboxes (filled spot?)
Notes/Targets	Text or color tag


Add filters to show only:

Available players at a position

Top-tier targets

Unfilled positions on your roster



---

🎨 Step 3: Conditional Formatting (Google Sheets/Excel)

Apply visual cues for rapid scan:

Green to red gradients based on score

Bold/highlight tiers

Color-tag sleepers or breakout targets

Use symbols (★, ⛔, ✅) to denote:

Must-draft

Injury risk

Already drafted




---

🧠 Step 4: Roster Build Monitoring (Live Draft Use)

During your draft:

Mark filled positions in real time

Filter for only top-tier players remaining

Auto-hide players as they’re drafted

Use pivot tables to compare total score by team or category



---

🔄 Optional: Integrate Live ADP or Draft Trends

If your dashboard links to a scraper or API (e.g., FantasyPros, NFBC, Yahoo), you can:

Flag ADP fallers

Track “value pockets” in live drafts

Show real-time tier breaks



---

✅ Summary: Visualization Toolkit

Tool	Use Case

## 1.5.9 – Exporting and Updating Your Rankings

Even the most accurate custom model will become outdated the moment a player gets injured, demoted, or promoted. That’s why a sustainable ranking system needs to support live updates, multi-format exports, and version control. In this section, we outline how to keep your rankings relevant from preseason drafts through the postseason.


---

🔄 Why Updating Matters

Player news (injuries, trades, promotions) affects projections and roles.

Platform ADP shifts quickly as trends go viral.

Your own strategy may evolve based on mock results or format changes.



---

📤 Exporting Formats: Where and How to Use Rankings

Format	Use Case	Output Style

CSV	Upload to drafting tools (e.g., Draft Wizard)	Flat table
Google Sheets	Live updating & mobile access	Interactive sheet
PDF	Offline backup / print view	Clean summary
JSON	For coding or importing into apps/scripts	Structured data
Web-hosted dashboard	Draft room sharing, team collaboration	Visual interface


> 🎯 Tip: Always keep a clean read-only backup of your original model before exporting to live draft tools.




---

🛠 Step-by-Step: Exporting from Google Sheets

1. Finalize Adjusted Score column.


2. Freeze headers and sort by score or tier.


3. Use File > Download As:

.csv for external tools

.xlsx for Excel users

.pdf for print-ready output



4. Use version control in the filename:

Baseball_Rankings_Tiered_v3_Aug3.csv





---

♻️ Automating Weekly Updates (Semi-Manual)

While real-time updates require scripting, you can manually refresh inputs and re-weight scores:

Workflow:

1. Re-import projection set (BatX, ATC, Steamer, etc.).


2. Recalculate weighted average (from 1.5.3).


3. Re-run score formulas (from 1.5.6).


4. Sort, tier, and update dashboard visuals.




---

🔌 Optional: Integrate Live Data with Scripts

For advanced users, consider:

Google Sheets Apps Script to auto-fetch projections from public APIs.

Python + pandas to rerun calculations and output new rankings weekly.

FantasyPros API / CSV downloads to integrate updated ADP or ECR.



---

🧠 Tip: Use Change Tracking Columns

Add columns to track movement week-to-week:

Player	This Week Rank	Last Week Rank	Change	Note

Zac Gallen	14	10	-4	Elbow soreness
Yainer Diaz	65	72	+7	Now full-time C


> Highlight movers to adjust tier boundaries or watchlist priorities.




---

🔒 Version Control Guidelines

Practice	Why It Matters

Archive weekly exports	Audit changes, compare evolution
Use timestamps	Track recency of rankings
Annotate changes	Document injury updates, trades, etc.
Tag draft version	Separate mock/preseason vs. live draft



---

✅ Summary: Updating & Exporting Best Practices

Always keep raw and adjusted rankings separate.

Export in formats tailored to your use (CSV for tools, PDF for meetings).

Refresh input data weekly or biweekly depending on format (daily for DFS).

Build toward dynamic integration with APIs if you need scale or automation.

## 1.5.10 – Real-Time Adjustment Factors & Context-Aware Ranks

Even with a well-structured custom model, static rankings lose value the moment the season begins. Injuries, playing time shifts, lineup changes, and ballpark conditions all affect player output on a daily basis. This final modeling layer introduces context-aware scoring, where real-time signals dynamically adjust your ranks and surface edge plays others may miss.


---

🔍 Key Adjustment Categories

Context Factor	Type	Sample Variables

Lineup Placement	Role-based	Batting 2nd vs. 7th, leadoff ABs
Platoon Splits	Opponent-specific	wOBA vs. LHP vs. RHP
Ballpark Effects	Environment	Park Factor (HR, Runs, BA)
Schedule Density	Opportunity	Games played this week
Opposing Pitcher	Matchup Quality	SP xERA, K%, BB%
Weather / Altitude	Run Environment	Wind, Coors Field effect



---

⚙️ Context-Aware Adjustment Formula

Context Score = Base Score × (1 + Adjustment Modifier)

Where:

Base Score = your custom model ranking

Adjustment Modifier = sum of all situational boosts (positive or negative)


> Example: A hitter with a base score of 72 plays at Coors Field vs. a weak LHP.

Adjustment: +8% for park, +5% platoon = +13%

Adjusted Score = 72 × 1.13 = 81.36




---

🧮 Creating Modifier Tables

You can pre-build context tables like:

Factor	Variable	Modifier

Coors Field	Park Factor > 1.20	+7%
Facing RHP	Player wOBA > .380 vs RHP	+5%
Batting 2nd	Lineup spot	+4%
Rain Forecast	Game delay risk	-3%
Facing SP (Top 10 K%)	High-strikeout pitcher	-6%


Use IF logic or VLOOKUP to apply modifiers based on context each day.


---

🛠 Implementation Tools

Tool/Platform	Use Case

Google Sheets	Manual input of daily factors
Python + pandas	Automate context updates
R (Shiny App)	Interactive visual adjustment tool
Draft Dashboard APIs	Pull real-time lineup data



---

🎯 DFS & Daily Leagues

Real-time adjustment models are essential in:

DFS lineup optimization

Streaming hitter/pitcher decisions

Late-week matchup swings in H2H


You can stack modifiers to surface undervalued spot plays each day.


---

📉 Context-Aware Drop Risk (Inverse Score)

Track negative context to flag possible sit/start decisions.

Player	Base Score	Context Mod (%)	Adjusted Score	Action

Matt Olson	88	-9% (vs LHP, @SEA)	80.08	Sit vs. LHP
Jarren Duran	61	+12% (vs RHP, leadoff)	68.32	Stream HIT



---

✅ Best Practices

Build a reusable Context Modifier Engine with dropdown inputs.

Assign confidence levels to real-time adjustments (weather = low confidence, park = high).

Add override flags for known injury/replacement starters.

Log daily adjustments for audit and revision.

1.5.11 - Building a Custom Ranking Model: Summary

In Section 1.5, we developed a complete framework for building and managing a personalized fantasy baseball ranking model. The approach combines statistical projections, customizable scoring logic, tier-based adjustments, and context-aware updates. Here's a concise recap of the core components:


---

🧱 Structural Overview

Subsection	Key Focus

1.5.1	Why default rankings are flawed and how to think independently
1.5.2	Gathering quality projection sources (e.g., Steamer, ATC)
1.5.3	Weighting projections using a blend of systems
1.5.4	Defining a scoring formula using league settings
1.5.5	Explaining each variable: AVG, K%, wOBA, BABIP, etc.
1.5.6	Adjusting rankings with tier logic and replacement baselines
1.5.7	Building position-specific rankings and applying scarcity
1.5.8	Tiering and formatting for live draft usability
1.5.9	Exporting and updating rankings with real-time inputs
1.5.10	Context-aware modifiers: park, pitcher matchups, lineups



---

🧮 Modeling Principles

Projections ≠ Rankings: A projection is an estimate; a ranking is an application.

Weighted Blending: Mixing multiple projection sources produces more stable estimates.

Positional Adjustment: Adjust for depth and volatility at each roster slot.

Tiering > Strict Order: Tier-based drafting protects against unnecessary positional runs.

Context Awareness: Game-day factors can shift a player’s value by 10%+.



---

✅ Outcome

By the end of this section, the manager has:

Built a fully operational fantasy ranking engine using spreadsheets or code.

Learned how to update rankings as new information emerges (injuries, depth chart changes).

Structured ranks for both season-long leagues and daily fantasy sports (DFS) formats.

Gained the flexibility to export, share, and visualize rankings as needed.
