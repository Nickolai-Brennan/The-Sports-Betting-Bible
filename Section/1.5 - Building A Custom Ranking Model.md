# 📊 1.5 – Building a Custom Ranking Model

## 1.5.0 - Introduction


Where Subjectivity Ends and Structure Begins

Fantasy managers often walk into their drafts clutching a cheat sheet printed from some expert’s site—usually a consensus ranking based on average projections. But here’s the hard truth: average advice builds average teams. If your league has unique scoring, custom rosters, or even just idiosyncratic opponents, then using a generic ranking list is like bringing a butter knife to a swordfight.

This chapter is about sharpening your edge. We're going to build a model—a systematic, numbers-first way to evaluate fantasy players that can be tuned to any format. Not only will this give you league-specific insights, but it will also remove the emotion, hype, and groupthink that cloud most decisions.

> “In God we trust. All others bring data.”
—W. Edwards Deming



A custom ranking model helps you assign real value to each player based on your league’s exact rules and roster configuration. Is your league PPR? Do quarterbacks get six points per touchdown? Do saves matter more than ERA? Your model accounts for that. Rather than blindly trusting ADP (Average Draft Position), you’ll build a ranking system that reflects true performance potential within your strategic context.

This isn’t just for advanced players. The methodology we’ll lay out uses basic tools: spreadsheets, projections, and a bit of math. You don’t need to know Python or machine learning. You just need to understand the fundamentals of how value is calculated—and how it can be distorted by format, risk, or positional scarcity.

Here’s what you’ll walk away with:

A personal ranking sheet that beats consensus lists.

Tiering logic that prevents panic picks.

VORP (Value Over Replacement Player) logic tailored to your format.

Methods for weighing volatility, injury risk, and upside properly.

Dynamic draft boards that evolve as projections shift.


In today’s meta, information is abundant, but insight is rare. This section bridges that gap by showing you how to turn raw data into draft-day confidence. Whether you’re a redraft purist, a dynasty builder, or a DFS optimizer, the tools in this chapter will elevate your game.

We’ll also cover how to adapt your model over time: tweaking inputs, adjusting scoring weights, and preparing for in-season player evaluations. Even if you’re not ready to abandon expert rankings completely, building your own model will expose inefficiencies in theirs.

Fantasy isn’t just about who scores the most—it’s about who scores the most relative to opportunity, scarcity, and context. That’s what this model uncovers.

Next: we break down what inputs you need to begin — projections, scoring settings, depth charts, and the building blocks of your custom engine.


---

## 1.5.1 – Defining Your Ranking Goals (Fantasy Baseball)

Before you can build a custom ranking model, you need to decide what you’re optimizing for. Fantasy baseball offers multiple formats—**Roto**, **Points**, **H2H Categories**, and **Best Ball**—and each rewards different statistical profiles. Your model must reflect your league’s structure, competitive landscape, and tolerance for risk.

### 🎯 Step 1: Match Format to Objective

| Format         | Goal                          | Implication                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Roto           | Balance across all categories | Avoid punting stats; weigh SBs/Saves higher |
| Points League  | Maximize projected points     | Volume matters; OBP > AVG                |
| H2H Categories | Weekly category wins          | Streaks + schedule impact rankings       |
| Best Ball      | Maximize spike weeks          | Prioritize volatility + ceiling          |

### 🧠 Example Use Case

If you’re in a 12-team **Roto** league using 5x5 scoring (AVG, HR, RBI, R, SB / W, ERA, WHIP, K, SV), your model needs to generate category-specific value projections. For instance, a player with moderate power but elite SB potential (like Esteury Ruiz) might rank higher than a pure slugger with no speed in this context.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Define Replacement Level

To calculate value over baseline, establish **replacement-level performance** for each position and stat category. This varies by format and league depth.

#### Example Replacement-Level Table (Roto, 12-team)

| Position | Replacement-Level Stats (Season Avg) |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| C        | 15 HR, 55 RBI, .235 AVG               |
| 1B       | 22 HR, 70 RBI, .250 AVG               |
| SS       | 12 HR, 20 SB, .260 AVG                |
| SP       | 150 IP, 8.5 K/9, 4.25 ERA             |
| RP       | 18 Saves, 3.60 ERA, 1.25 WHIP         |

You’ll use this table to calculate **Value Over Replacement (VORP)** in your model.

---

### 📈 Step 3: Choose Your Output

Decide whether your model will output:

- **Raw Projected Stats** per player
- **Category-weighted scores** (for Roto)
- **Overall Rankings**
- **Tiered Value Buckets**

The more detailed the output, the more complex your logic—but also the more customizable your draft approach.

---

### 📊 Formula Preview

To guide your ranking model, your base formula may look like this:

```
`VORP = Player Stat – Replacement Stat`
```

Later subsections will expand this to include z-scores, weighted category multipliers, and scoring-based projection adjustments.

---

## 1.5.2 – Gathering Player Projections & Stat Inputs (Fantasy Baseball)

A ranking model is only as good as the data that powers it. In this section, we’ll walk through where to get projections, what types of stats matter, and how to structure your inputs for modeling purposes.

---

### 📥 Step 1: Choose Your Projection Sources

High-quality projections come in many flavors. Most fantasy baseball models are built on publicly available or subscription-based datasets.

| Source         | Type         | Notes                                      |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| FanGraphs (Depth Charts, Steamer) | Season-long projections | Free; CSV exportable; widely used |
| Baseball Prospectus (PECOTA) | Advanced projections     | Paid; includes aging curves and comps |
| Razzball          | Fantasy-specific stats  | Includes auction values and $ estimates |
| THE BAT (by Derek Carty) | DFS & Season-long      | Highly accurate; available on Fangraphs or Rotogrinders |
| Rotowire / CBS / ESPN | Platform rankings       | Useful for ADP comparison, not modeling |

> 🧠 Tip: Use multiple sources and average them to reduce bias.

---

### 🧮 Step 2: Define Key Stats by Format

For **Roto leagues**, the 5x5 standard (HR, R, RBI, SB, AVG / W, K, ERA, WHIP, SV) is the core. But even within those, some stats are more predictable and modelable than others.

#### 🧾 Suggested Stat Inputs for Hitters:

- HR, R, RBI, SB
- AVG (or OBP if used)
- PA (plate appearances) – for volume scaling

#### 🧾 Suggested Stat Inputs for Pitchers:

- IP (innings pitched)
- K, W, SV
- ERA, WHIP
- K/9, BB/9, HR/9 (advanced projection sanity checks)

---

### 🗂️ Step 3: Organize Your Input Sheet

All data should be cleaned and consistently formatted. Start with a Google Sheet or Excel workbook structured like this:

| Player Name | Team | Pos | PA | HR | R | RBI | SB | AVG | W | SV | K | ERA | WHIP |
|-------------|------|-----|----|----|---|-----|----|-----|---|----|---|-----|------|
| Juan Soto   | NYY  | OF  | 650| 32 | 96| 90  | 8  | .295| — | —  | — | —   | —    |
| Spencer Strider | ATL | SP | —  | —  | — | —   | —  | —   | 16| 0  | 240| 3.20| 1.10 |

> 📦 Create separate tabs for hitters and pitchers.

---

### 🔁 Optional: Add Historical Data

Overlay 1–2 years of actual player stats to compare projections with past performance. This improves model validation and lets you spot outliers or injury recoveries.

| Player | Year | HR | RBI | AVG | K | IP | ERA |
|--------|------|----|-----|-----|---|----|-----|
| Soto   | 2023 | 35 | 109 | .290| — | —  | —   |
| Strider| 2023 | —  | —   | —   | 281| 186| 3.86|

### ✅ Summary

Gathering clean, positionally-diverse, and format-specific projections is the backbone of any fantasy baseball model. The quality of your rankings starts with how reliable and relevant your inputs are.

---

### 1.5.3 – Sourcing and Cleaning Baseball Data

Accurate rankings start with quality inputs. Before modeling, data must be **sourced, verified, and cleaned**. Dirty or inconsistent inputs will degrade projection quality and introduce bias into rankings.

---

#### 🗂️ Step 1: Identify Reliable Data Sources

You’ll need multiple stat feeds to build a comprehensive model. Some of the most used platforms for fantasy baseball data include:

| Source            | Data Provided                                          | Use Case                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| FanGraphs         | Advanced metrics (wOBA, xFIP, K-BB%, BABIP)            | Projection calibration, regression inputs|
| Baseball Savant   | Statcast data (Exit Velo, Launch Angle, Barrel%)      | Quality of contact, aging curves         |
| Baseball Reference| Historical and seasonal player stats                   | Consistency trends, park factors         |
| Rotowire / RotoBaller | Player news, injuries, depth charts              | Context adjustments, injury discounts    |
| FantasyPros       | ADP, ECR (Expert Consensus Rankings)                  | Market value mapping                     |

---

#### 🧹 Step 2: Clean and Normalize the Data

Once sourced, all datasets must be standardized. This includes formatting columns, handling missing values, and ensuring uniform naming conventions.

**Cleaning Checklist:**
- Ensure all players are referenced using a unified naming schema (e.g., full name, team, position)
- Standardize units (e.g., converting innings pitched into decimal format)
- Remove players with <50 ABs or <10 IP (unless prospect stashing)
- Handle missing fields with defaults or regression fill-ins
- Confirm statistical ranges are within logical bounds (e.g., BABIP between .200–.400)

**Normalization Techniques:**
- Scale stats like HR or SB per 600 PA for batters or per 180 IP for pitchers
- Convert counting stats to rates for better comparison (e.g., HR/PA, K/9)
- Use Z-scores or Min-Max scaling to align metric scales for multi-factor models

---

#### 🔀 Step 3: Merge Data into a Master Sheet

To build a functional model, create a unified spreadsheet or database that includes all relevant metrics for each player.

**Recommended Columns for Hitters:**
- Player Name
- Team
- Position
- PA (Plate Appearances)
- AVG / OBP / SLG / wOBA
- HR / SB / RBI / R / BB%
- Statcast metrics (Barrel%, EV, Launch Angle)

**Recommended Columns for Pitchers:**
- Player Name
- Team
- IP (Innings Pitched)
- ERA / WHIP / K% / BB% / xFIP / BABIP
- SwStr%, GB%, HR/FB
- Velocity, Pitch Mix (if available)

---

#### 🔗 Final Output

The result of this step is a **clean master dataset** that serves as the foundation for projection modeling and ranking calculations.

You can now feed this into Excel, R, Python, or Google Sheets, depending on your modeling preference.

---

### 1.5.4 – Selecting and Weighting Performance Metrics (Expanded)

To build a robust and accurate fantasy baseball ranking model, the core lies in selecting **relevant metrics** and assigning **smart weights**. These define how your model interprets player performance. This deeper dive outlines not just what to include, but how to structure, weight, and normalize these inputs.

---

#### 🧠 Why Weighting Matters

Fantasy leagues award value differently depending on format. A stolen base in roto might be worth as much as a home run due to category scarcity. In contrast, in a points league, the HR may outscore a SB 4:1. Without correct weighting, your rankings will fail to reflect true in-league value.

---

#### 🔎 Selecting Stats: Foundation vs. Flavor

**Foundation metrics** are core stats that correlate highly with fantasy scoring (e.g., HR, K, OBP). **Flavor metrics** are supplemental—often advanced—used to adjust for sustainability or hidden value (e.g., Barrel%, BABIP, SwStr%).

##### Example – Hitters:

| Category   | Stat         | Why It Matters                                      |
|------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Power      | HR, ISO      | Direct fantasy value, signals raw slugging         |
| Plate Disc.| BB%, K%      | Determines OBP, floor, upside stability             |
| Contact    | AVG, BABIP   | Measures consistency and possible regression        |
| Speed      | SB, BsR      | Scarce stat; BsR signals base-stealing capability   |
| Advanced   | wOBA, xwOBA  | Captures overall offensive contribution             |
| Quality    | Barrel%, EV  | Indicates power sustainability and breakout risk    |

##### Example – Pitchers:

| Category     | Stat        | Why It Matters                                      |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Dominance    | K/9, K%     | Strikeouts = fantasy points, category wins          |
| Efficiency   | BB/9, K-BB% | Reflects command; core predictor of ERA             |
| Run Control  | ERA, xERA   | Actual vs. expected run prevention                  |
| Contact Mgt. | WHIP, HR/9  | WHIP = category win; HRs penalize in points leagues |
| Swing Stuff  | CSW%, SwStr%| Indicates future strikeout potential                |

---

#### ⚖️ Assigning Weights: Methods

##### 1. **Subjective Scaling (Roto)**
Assign weights based on:
- Category scarcity
- Category volatility
- Correlation to league standings

Example for Hitters in 5x5 Roto:

| Metric | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| HR     | 0.25   |
| AVG    | 0.20   |
| R      | 0.15   |
| RBI    | 0.20   |
| SB     | 0.20   |

> 📌 *Note:* SB might get a 25% weight in leagues where speed is scarce.

##### 2. **Scoring-Based Weights (Points League)**
Mirror platform scoring (Fantrax, Yahoo, ESPN).

Example for Pitchers (Fantrax Points):

| Metric | League Value | Weight |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| IP     | 3 pts/IP     | 0.25   |
| K      | 1 pt/K       | 0.20   |
| ER     | -1 pt/ER     | -0.15  |
| BB     | -0.5 pt/BB   | -0.10  |
| W      | 6 pts/W      | 0.15   |
| QS     | 3 pts/QS     | 0.15   |

---

#### 📏 Normalization Techniques

Metrics with different units (e.g., AVG vs. HR) must be normalized before combining. Two options:

##### Method 1: **Z-Score**

```
Z = (Player Stat – Mean Stat) / Standard Deviation
```

- Centers data around 0
- Highlights outliers
- Ideal for multi-metric synthesis

##### Method 2: **Min-Max Scaling**

```
Scaled = (Value – Min) / (Max – Min)
```

- Range 0–1
- Easy for weighting and visualization
- Preserves original distribution shape

> ⚠️ Use the same method for all metrics in the model to avoid distortion.

---

#### 🧮 Final Output Formula (Generic)

```
Weighted Score = Σ (Normalized Stat × Assigned Weight)
```

Example for a hitter:

★
```
Weighted Score = (Z_HR × 0.25) + (Z_AVG × 0.20) + (Z_R × 0.15) + (Z_RBI × 0.20) + (Z_SB × 0.20)
```

---

#### 🛠 Implementation Tip

Organize each player as a row in a spreadsheet or database. Assign columns for:
- Raw stats
- Normalized stats
- Weighted metrics
- Final score

You’ll use this final score in **1.5.5** to rank and sort players.
