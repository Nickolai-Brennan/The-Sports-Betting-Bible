## 1.5.0 - Introduction


Where Subjectivity Ends and Structure Begins

Fantasy managers often walk into their drafts clutching a cheat sheet printed from some expert‚Äôs site‚Äîusually a consensus ranking based on average projections. But here‚Äôs the hard truth: average advice builds average teams. If your league has unique scoring, custom rosters, or even just idiosyncratic opponents, then using a generic ranking list is like bringing a butter knife to a swordfight.

This chapter is about sharpening your edge. We're going to build a model‚Äîa systematic, numbers-first way to evaluate fantasy players that can be tuned to any format. Not only will this give you league-specific insights, but it will also remove the emotion, hype, and groupthink that cloud most decisions.

A custom ranking model helps you assign real value to each player based on your league‚Äôs exact rules and roster configuration. Is your league PPR? Do quarterbacks get six points per touchdown? Do saves matter more than ERA? Your model accounts for that. Rather than blindly trusting ADP (Average Draft Position), you‚Äôll build a ranking system that reflects true performance potential within your strategic context.

This isn‚Äôt just for advanced players. The methodology we‚Äôll lay out uses basic tools: spreadsheets, projections, and a bit of math. You don‚Äôt need to know Python or machine learning. You just need to understand the fundamentals of how value is calculated‚Äîand how it can be distorted by format, risk, or positional scarcity.

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll walk away with:

A personal ranking sheet that beats consensus lists.

Tiering logic that prevents panic picks.

VORP (Value Over Replacement Player) logic tailored to your format.

Methods for weighing volatility, injury risk, and upside properly.

Dynamic draft boards that evolve as projections shift.


In today‚Äôs meta, information is abundant, but insight is rare. This section bridges that gap by showing you how to turn raw data into draft-day confidence. Whether you‚Äôre a redraft purist, a dynasty builder, or a DFS optimizer, the tools in this chapter will elevate your game.

We‚Äôll also cover how to adapt your model over time: tweaking inputs, adjusting scoring weights, and preparing for in-season player evaluations. Even if you‚Äôre not ready to abandon expert rankings completely, building your own model will expose inefficiencies in theirs.

Fantasy isn‚Äôt just about who scores the most‚Äîit‚Äôs about who scores the most relative to opportunity, scarcity, and context. That‚Äôs what this model uncovers.

## 1.5.1 ‚Äì Defining Your Ranking Goals (Fantasy Baseball)

Before you can build a custom ranking model, you need to decide what you‚Äôre optimizing for. Fantasy baseball offers multiple formats‚Äî**Roto**, **Points**, **H2H Categories**, and **Best Ball**‚Äîand each rewards different statistical profiles. Your model must reflect your league‚Äôs structure, competitive landscape, and tolerance for risk.

### üéØ Step 1: Match Format to Objective

| Format         | Goal                          | Implication                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Roto           | Balance across all categories | Avoid punting stats; weigh SBs/Saves higher |
| Points League  | Maximize projected points     | Volume matters; OBP > AVG                |
| H2H Categories | Weekly category wins          | Streaks + schedule impact rankings       |
| Best Ball      | Maximize spike weeks          | Prioritize volatility + ceiling          |

### üß† Example Use Case

If you‚Äôre in a 12-team **Roto** league using 5x5 scoring (AVG, HR, RBI, R, SB / W, ERA, WHIP, K, SV), your model needs to generate category-specific value projections. For instance, a player with moderate power but elite SB potential (like Esteury Ruiz) might rank higher than a pure slugger with no speed in this context.

---

### üîç Step 2: Define Replacement Level

To calculate value over baseline, establish **replacement-level performance** for each position and stat category. This varies by format and league depth.

#### Example Replacement-Level Table (Roto, 12-team)

| Position | Replacement-Level Stats (Season Avg) |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| C        | 15 HR, 55 RBI, .235 AVG               |
| 1B       | 22 HR, 70 RBI, .250 AVG               |
| SS       | 12 HR, 20 SB, .260 AVG                |
| SP       | 150 IP, 8.5 K/9, 4.25 ERA             |
| RP       | 18 Saves, 3.60 ERA, 1.25 WHIP         |

You‚Äôll use this table to calculate **Value Over Replacement (VORP)** in your model.

---

### üìà Step 3: Choose Your Output

Decide whether your model will output:

- **Raw Projected Stats** per player
- **Category-weighted scores** (for Roto)
- **Overall Rankings**
- **Tiered Value Buckets**

The more detailed the output, the more complex your logic‚Äîbut also the more customizable your draft approach.

---

### üìä Formula Preview

To guide your ranking model, your base formula may look like this:

```
`VORP = Player Stat ‚Äì Replacement Stat`
```

Later subsections will expand this to include z-scores, weighted category multipliers, and scoring-based projection adjustments.
