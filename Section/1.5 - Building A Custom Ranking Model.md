## 1.5.0 - Introduction


Where Subjectivity Ends and Structure Begins

Fantasy managers often walk into their drafts clutching a cheat sheet printed from some expert‚Äôs site‚Äîusually a consensus ranking based on average projections. But here‚Äôs the hard truth: average advice builds average teams. If your league has unique scoring, custom rosters, or even just idiosyncratic opponents, then using a generic ranking list is like bringing a butter knife to a swordfight.

This chapter is about sharpening your edge. We're going to build a model‚Äîa systematic, numbers-first way to evaluate fantasy players that can be tuned to any format. Not only will this give you league-specific insights, but it will also remove the emotion, hype, and groupthink that cloud most decisions.

A custom ranking model helps you assign real value to each player based on your league‚Äôs exact rules and roster configuration. Is your league PPR? Do quarterbacks get six points per touchdown? Do saves matter more than ERA? Your model accounts for that. Rather than blindly trusting ADP (Average Draft Position), you‚Äôll build a ranking system that reflects true performance potential within your strategic context.

This isn‚Äôt just for advanced players. The methodology we‚Äôll lay out uses basic tools: spreadsheets, projections, and a bit of math. You don‚Äôt need to know Python or machine learning. You just need to understand the fundamentals of how value is calculated‚Äîand how it can be distorted by format, risk, or positional scarcity.

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll walk away with:

A personal ranking sheet that beats consensus lists.

Tiering logic that prevents panic picks.

VORP (Value Over Replacement Player) logic tailored to your format.

Methods for weighing volatility, injury risk, and upside properly.

Dynamic draft boards that evolve as projections shift.


In today‚Äôs meta, information is abundant, but insight is rare. This section bridges that gap by showing you how to turn raw data into draft-day confidence. Whether you‚Äôre a redraft purist, a dynasty builder, or a DFS optimizer, the tools in this chapter will elevate your game.

We‚Äôll also cover how to adapt your model over time: tweaking inputs, adjusting scoring weights, and preparing for in-season player evaluations. Even if you‚Äôre not ready to abandon expert rankings completely, building your own model will expose inefficiencies in theirs.

Fantasy isn‚Äôt just about who scores the most‚Äîit‚Äôs about who scores the most relative to opportunity, scarcity, and context. That‚Äôs what this model uncovers.
