# 1.2 – League Types & How They Change the Game

### *Formats Define Strategy, and Strategy Defines Success*

---

## 🎮 Not All Fantasy Leagues Are Created Equal

Fantasy sports are far from one-size-fits-all. The structure of your league shapes every decision you make: who you draft, when you trade, how you plan, and what edge you pursue. Two players with identical knowledge can have wildly different outcomes depending on league settings.

In this chapter, we’ll break down the most popular league types — from casual weekend warrior leagues to ultra-competitive dynasty empires — and show how each format demands its own approach.

> Your format is your framework. It defines what winning looks like.

Let’s explore how.

## 📊 Redraft Leagues: The Annual Reset

### The Format:

* Most common for casual and semi-serious players.
* Rosters are drafted fresh each season.
* No carryover. No contracts. Clean slate every year.

### Key Strategies:

* **Draft Prep is King** – Your entire season depends on a single draft.
* **Waiver Wire Hustle** – Success hinges on making the right in-season pickups.
* **Short-Term Risk is Acceptable** – You don’t have to think beyond this year.

### Real-Life Example:

Liam joins a 10-team redraft league with coworkers. He uses rankings from FantasyPros, drafts Mahomes early, and picks up De’Von Achane in Week 3. That one waiver pickup leads to the highest-scoring team in the league.

> 🧠 Pro Tip: In redraft, value ADP trends and injury outlooks more than long-term ceiling.

## 🏆 Dynasty Leagues: The GM Simulator

### The Format:

* You keep your entire roster year to year.
* Draft includes prospects, minor leaguers, rookies.
* Active trading of future draft picks.

### Key Strategies:

* **Long-Term Roster Building** – Plan 2–3 years ahead.
* **Age and Upside Matter** – Older stars are discounted.
* **Prospect Scouting** – Knowledge of player development is gold.

### Real-Life Example:

Tasha trades away Austin Ekeler and Keenan Allen for Garrett Wilson and two 2024 first-rounders. She misses the playoffs that year but builds a dynasty that wins back-to-back titles.

> 🧠 Pro Tip: Depth > flash. Depth wins over time.

---

## 🧲 Keeper Leagues: The Middle Ground

### The Format:

* Keep 1–5 players each year.
* Some leagues use draft-round penalties (e.g., keep a player in the round you drafted them).

### Key Strategies:

* **Draft for Value, Not Just Production** – Finding breakout rookies in later rounds pays off next season.
* **Watch for Trade Windows** – Timing matters when dealing veterans.
* **Build Around Anchors** – Lock in long-term assets.

### Real-Life Example:

Chris kept Jalen Hurts in the 12th round and Bijan Robinson in the 5th. With elite production from cheap draft slots, he dominated the league.

> 🧠 Pro Tip: Your "keepers" are your discount stars. Draft with future years in mind.

---

## ⚔️ Head-to-Head Leagues (H2H)

### The Format:

* Weekly matchups between two teams.
* Win more categories (or points) to win the matchup.
* Playoffs determine the champion.

### Key Strategies:

* **Play the Schedule** – Know your opponent's strengths and stream accordingly.
* **Maximize Categories** – Don't waste roster spots on duplicated stats.
* **Ride Hot Streaks** – Weekly volatility is your friend.

### Real-Life Example:

Jorge’s team was 9–9 going into the playoffs but had players with strong schedules (extra games, weak pitching matchups). He streamed hot hitters and won the championship with a mediocre regular-season record.

> 🧠 Pro Tip: Playoffs are a different game. Schedule matters more than season-long stats.

---

## 📈 Rotisserie (Roto) Leagues

### The Format:

* Standings based on cumulative season-long performance.
* Categories ranked 1–10 or 1–12 depending on league size.
* No weekly matchups — pure statistical accumulation.

### Key Strategies:

* **Balance is Critical** – You can’t punt categories and still win.
* **In-Season Tracking** – Excel or Google Sheets are a must.
* **Fix Weak Spots Early** – Gaps widen the longer you wait.

### Real-Life Example:

Angela realized in May that she was last in saves. She traded a mid-tier starter for a top closer and clawed back to the middle. It saved her season.

> 🧠 Pro Tip: Roto is a grind. Be proactive, not reactive.

---

## 💰 Points Leagues

### The Format:

* Each action earns a point value (e.g., yards, goals, Ks).
* Weekly matchups or cumulative season totals.

### Key Strategies:

* **Volume Over Category Diversity** – Floor players become more valuable.
* **Position Scarcity Less Relevant** – Just grab the best scorers.
* **Projections Matter More** – Use data models and simulators.

### Real-Life Example:

Eli drafted a team full of high-floor volume RBs in a fantasy football points league. He didn’t care about receiving stats or style — just 20 touches per game. He went 11–2.

> 🧠 Pro Tip: Think like a DFS optimizer — raw points over balance.

---

## ⚡ Best Ball Leagues

### The Format:

* Draft-only. No trades, waivers, or lineup setting.
* Your best-scoring players automatically count each week.

### Key Strategies:

* **Draft for Spike Weeks** – Boom > consistency.
* **Depth Wins** – Injuries can’t be replaced, so draft insurance.
* **Stacking Works** – QB-WR combos are lethal.

### Real-Life Example:

Brittany drafted Josh Allen, Stefon Diggs, Gabe Davis. That stack gave her three top-10 weeks during the playoffs and carried her to a tournament finish.

> 🧠 Pro Tip: Draft multiple TE/WR late — you only need a few hits.

---

## 🔮 Superflex & 2QB Leagues

### The Format:

* You can start two QBs weekly (or use one in a FLEX).

### Key Strategies:

* **Early QB Drafting Becomes Critical** – Positional scarcity is real.
* **Late-Round Gems Become Starters** – Think Howell, Ridder, etc.

### Real-Life Example:

Daniel drafted Kirk Cousins in Round 3 and Jordan Love in Round 8. Cousins got hurt midseason, but Love’s late surge kept Daniel in playoff contention.

> 🧠 Pro Tip: QB depth wins championships.

---

## 💼 IDP (Individual Defensive Player) Leagues

### The Format:

* Players draft linebackers, safeties, DEs, etc.
* Defensive stats earn fantasy points (tackles, sacks, INTs).

### Key Strategies:

* **Understand Scoring Settings** – Are tackles 1 point? Are sacks 3 or 6?
* **Volume Tacklers Are Gold** – Think Roquan Smith.

### Real-Life Example:

Taylor used IDP charts to find DBs on high-pass-volume defenses. She targeted Jalen Pitre and finished top 3 in defensive scoring.

> 🧠 Pro Tip: Treat IDPs like flex backs — it’s all about volume.

---

## 🤯 Combo & Custom Leagues

These leagues mash formats or create wild hybrids:

* **Super Dynasty with contracts**
* **Multi-sport leagues (NBA/NFL combined)**
* **Auction Keeper Hybrid**
* **Two-week playoff matchups**

> 🧠 Pro Tip: The more complex the rules, the more edge you can find. Master the format, and you master the meta.

---

## 🔑 Final Word: Know Your Format, Master Your Edge

Every league type changes:

* How you draft
* Who you target
* When you trade
* Where you focus your effort

Understanding your format is the first edge you can earn — and the easiest one to forget.

> "Don't bring roto strategy into a head-to-head street fight."

Play the game your league is playing — not the one you *wish* it were playing.
