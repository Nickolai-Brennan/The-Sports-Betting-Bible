# 1.2 – League Types & How They Change the Game

### 1.2.0 - League Types Introduction

## 🎮 Not All Fantasy Leagues Are Created Equal

Fantasy sports are far from one-size-fits-all. The structure of your league shapes every decision you make: who you draft, when you trade, how you plan, and what edge you pursue. Two players with identical knowledge can have wildly different outcomes depending on league settings.

In this chapter, we’ll break down the most popular league types — from casual weekend warrior leagues to ultra-competitive dynasty empires — and show how each format demands its own approach.

> Your format is your framework. It defines what winning looks like.

Let’s explore how.

### 📊 1.2.1 Redraft Leagues: The Annual Reset

*“One season, one shot. No safety net. No legacy. Just now.”*

---

Redraft leagues are the foundation of fantasy sports. They represent the most familiar, most accessible, and most widely played format — particularly for new and casual players. Each season begins with a fresh draft. There are no keeper rules, no long-term investments, and no player carryovers. Just a clean slate and a countdown clock.

This format levels the playing field annually, making every draft a high-stakes decision zone. Whether you're a first-time player or a seasoned veteran, redraft leagues demand you deliver value at every turn — because there's no second chance next year.

---

## 🔁 How It Works

A typical redraft season follows a simple, annual cycle:

1. **Draft Day**: Each manager selects their entire team from scratch — typically via snake draft or auction format.
2. **Weekly Play**: You start lineups, manage injuries, and hit the waiver wire to maximize scoring.
3. **Matchups and Standings**: In head-to-head leagues, you face opponents weekly. In roto or points formats, you accumulate stats toward a leaderboard.
4. **Playoffs**: Usually held in the final weeks of the real-life season. Top teams enter a bracket to compete for the title.
5. **Reset**: At season’s end, all rosters dissolve. Everyone re-enters the draft pool for the next season.

---

## 🧠 Strategic Implications

### ✅ Short-Term Thinking Is Strategic Thinking

In redraft, you’re building for the here and now. There’s no reward for stashing a rookie who won’t play until next year. A productive 30-year-old veteran can be more valuable than a hyped prospect.

> “Redraft is chess on a shot clock. You’re constantly balancing risk and upside within a compressed window.”

### 🔥 The Draft Is Everything

The opening draft often determines 60–70% of a team’s success. With no carryover and limited trade markets, missing early picks can cripple your team. That’s why rankings, tiers, and mock drafts are essential prep tools.

### 🔄 Weekly Agility Wins

Because every roster is new each year, managers must stay active. Streaming defenses, rotating bench depth, and making FAAB bids are part of the grind.

## ⚖️ Pros and Cons of Redraft

| 🔼 Pros                              | 🔽 Cons                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Accessible and beginner-friendly     | Little long-term continuity          |
| Annual reset = clean slate each year | More variance; one bad draft hurts   |
| Easy to recruit players              | Can feel “shallow” to advanced users |
| Great for casual/social leagues      | Trades often less impactful          |

---

## 🔍 Draft Room Tactics

### 📈 Use Tiers, Not Just Rankings

Tier-based drafting helps you avoid positional cliffs. For example, if you’re on the clock and there are only two Tier-2 RBs left but five Tier-2 WRs, grab the RB — WRs will still be there next round.

### 🚫 Fade Preseason Hype

Overvaluing rookies or breakout predictions is common. In redraft, you want players with defined roles, consistent usage, and early-season opportunity.

### 🛡️ Draft Floor with Upside

Your early picks should offer reliability (floor); mid and late rounds can be reserved for breakout swings (upside).

---

## 📦 The Waiver Wire Game

Redraft is often won on the wire, not just at the draft. Key waiver moves:

* **Early-season breakouts** (e.g., a surprise RB1 from an injury)
* **Midseason volume spikes** (e.g., WR2s taking over WR1 roles)
* **Defensive and kicker streaming** (based on matchup data)

> Case Study: In 2023, Puka Nacua was undrafted in most redraft leagues. After Week 1’s 10-catch game, sharp managers blew FAAB early — and were rewarded with a WR1 season.

---

## 💰 FAAB vs. Rolling Waivers

Many leagues use a Free Agent Acquisition Budget (FAAB) to bid on players. This adds strategy and forces managers to allocate limited capital wisely.

| Waiver Type      | Strategic Implication                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Rolling Priority | Patience rewarded; risk of never getting “the guy” |
| FAAB             | Budget strategy = hidden edge                      |

---

## 📅 Weekly Planning

Redraft requires weekly lineup management, which includes:

* **Start/sit decisions**: Based on matchups and injuries.
* **Bye week navigation**: Especially for QB/TE positions.
* **Streaming options**: DST and K, plus 2nd-tier FLEX plays.

> Pro Tip: Use tools like FantasyPros’ Start/Sit Assistant or ECR (Expert Consensus Rankings) to identify the right lineup edge.

---

## 🤝 Trading in Redraft

Trades are rarer in redraft because of time constraints and reluctance to gamble. But savvy managers can:

* Sell high on unsustainable performances.
* Buy low on injured stars who will return midseason.
* Exploit manager desperation (e.g., 2-for-1 trades).

> “In redraft, the best trades often come after Week 3 — when overreactions peak.”

## 🔄 Common Redraft Formats

| League Type         | Notes                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard H2H Points | Weekly matchups; playoffs in Weeks 15–17             |
| PPR/0.5 PPR         | Points per reception boost WRs/RBs with high targets |
| Superflex (2QB)     | QBs become high-value targets early                  |
| Auction Redraft     | Salary-based draft; more freedom but longer setup    |

---

## 🧠 Mental Edge: Focus, Not Forecast

Because redraft doesn’t require multiyear planning, it rewards managers who:

* Focus deeply on the **now**
* Capitalize on market **inefficiencies**
* Adapt faster than others to weekly shifts

There’s no need to worry about next year’s ADP or aging curves — just win **this** season.

---

## 📚 Summary Checklist: Winning in Redraft

✔ Prioritize players with defined roles and early-season usage
✔ Draft using tiers to avoid positional drop-offs
✔ Target floor early, upside late
✔ Manage waivers proactively, especially Weeks 1–4
✔ Make data-informed start/sit decisions weekly
✔ Know your format and scoring settings
✔ Don’t overthink: simple, repeatable processes work

### 🏆 1.2.2 Dynasty Leagues: The GM Simulator

*“You’re not just playing this season — you’re building a legacy.”*

---

Dynasty leagues are the most immersive format in fantasy sports. Unlike redraft leagues, where every season resets, dynasty leagues retain most or all of your roster from year to year. It’s the closest thing fantasy players get to running an actual franchise — making long-term roster decisions, developing talent, and balancing today’s wins against tomorrow’s potential.

Dynasty formats are slower, deeper, and more strategic. You’re no longer just drafting for Week 1 — you’re drafting for 2026.

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. **Initial Startup Draft**: A deep draft of 25–35 players, often including rookies, veterans, and stashes.
2. **Annual Rookie Drafts**: Each offseason, managers draft incoming rookies (NFL, NBA, MLB) based on their league’s rules.
3. **Year-Round Management**: No off-season. Trading, waivers, and prospect stashing continue all year.
4. **Retention Rules**: Most leagues keep 100% of rosters. Some have salary caps, contract years, or keeper limits.

---

## 🧠 Strategic Implications

### 🏗️ Build Long, Not Fast

In dynasty, you can’t afford to play just for this year — unless you're already a contender. You must balance production and age. Veterans win you games. Youth wins you titles *later.*

> “In redraft, you draft to win. In dynasty, you draft to *build*.”

### 🔄 Trade with Windows

Every player is on a curve: breakout, peak, decline. Trade *before* the peak, not after. Buy dips, not hype.

> Real-life play: Selling Dalvin Cook at age 27 for Javonte Williams + picks before injury decline.

---

## 📈 Player Value Changes Constantly

In dynasty, a player’s value is dynamic:

| Player Type        | High Value When...                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Rookie Prospect    | Draft season, post-draft buzz                |
| Breakout Candidate | New role, strong preseason, new coach        |
| Aging Veteran      | Just before performance cliff (sell early)   |
| Backup with Upside | Starter injury, new system, depth chart move |

Use these moments to buy or sell.

---

## 🏛️ Dynasty League Structure Variants

* **Superflex Dynasty**: Start 2 QBs. Increases QB draft capital significantly.
* **Contract Leagues**: Players have “contracts” (e.g., 3 years max) and salaries.
* **Devy Leagues**: Draft NCAA players before they go pro — ultra-deep.
* **IDP Dynasty**: Combine dynasty with defensive players — for true immersion.

---

## 🛠️ Roster Management Strategy

* **Anchor Around Youth**: Build around players in Year 1–3 of their career.
* **Depth Over Stars**: Injuries and development curves require a deep bench.
* **Stash for Ceiling**: Use final roster spots for developmental players.
* **Track Situational Value**: Opportunity > talent in the short term.

> Tip: Rebuilding? Target injured stars or underused rookies and stack future picks.

---

## 📊 Draft Strategy in Startups

* **Go WR-Heavy Early**: Wide receivers have longer career arcs than RBs.
* **Fade Aging Stars**: Even elite vets lose value fast in dynasty formats.
* **Stack Future Picks**: If you’re not contending Year 1, punt and build for Year 2–3.

Startup Example:

* Round 1: Ja’Marr Chase (22 years old)
* Round 2: Garrett Wilson
* Round 3: Kyle Pitts
* Round 4: Travis Etienne
* Round 5: 2025 1st-round pick via trade

---

## 🔄 Dynasty Trading Framework

Dynasty trades are complex. Think in terms of:

* **Age Curve**: RBs fall off earlier, WRs age slower.
* **Team Window**: Are you building or competing?
* **Pick Value**: Rookie picks gain value the closer you get to the draft.
* **Market Psychology**: Hype cycles matter — sell into them.

> Case: A rebuilding team trades Travis Kelce (33) for Michael Mayer + two 2025 2nd-rounders. Long-term value, short-term loss.

---

## 🧮 Analytics in Dynasty

Use long-term metrics:

* **Age-adjusted production curves**
* **Breakout age (e.g., age-19 dominator rating)**
* **Volume trends (touch % over time)**
* **Regression indicators** (e.g., unsustainable TD% or YPC)

Track historical bust rates, draft capital correlations, and target share over time to model outlooks.

---

## ⏳ Dynasty Is a Game of Timing

In dynasty:

* The team that waits too long to rebuild declines quickly.
* The team that bails too soon might miss a title window.
* The team that buys a year ahead of breakout wins cheap.

Timing is everything — especially in multi-year formats.

---

## 🧠 Mental Game: Patience > Panic

Dynasty rewards managers who:

* Don’t overreact to short-term dips
* Understand value curves by position
* Can balance production vs. marketability
* Have a long-view strategy and discipline

---

## 🧾 Summary Checklist: Winning in Dynasty

✔ Draft young, high-upside players
✔ Sell aging producers at peak value
✔ Accumulate and stack future picks
✔ Build WR core before RB depth
✔ Make every roster spot earn future value
✔ Track college prospects early (for Devy)
✔ Learn your league’s specific structure (Superflex, IDP, etc.)
✔ Play the long game — and win it
