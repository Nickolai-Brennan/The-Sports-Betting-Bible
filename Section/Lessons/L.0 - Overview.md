## Lessons Overview: From Reading to Mastery
```
This book was designed not just to teach conceptsâ€”but to help you build and apply them. The Lessons section provides hands-on, guided exercises that mirror real-world fantasy sports tasks, tools, and strategies.

Each lesson connects directly to a major section of the book, offering a structured walkthrough you can complete using spreadsheets, projection data, and league-specific rules.

These lessons are not optional extras. They are your labâ€”where the strategy becomes skill.
