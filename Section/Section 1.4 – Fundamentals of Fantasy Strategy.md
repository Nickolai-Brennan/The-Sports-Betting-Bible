# Section 1.4 – Fundamentals of Fantasy Strategy

## 🧠 From Gut to Gameplan: How Strategy Defines Success

In fantasy sports, **everyone starts with the same basic tools**—a draft, a roster, and a scoring system. What separates contenders from pretenders is not luck, but **strategy**.

Good strategy is not about overcomplicating the game—it’s about making a series of consistent, small, +EV (positive expected value) decisions. Whether it’s who to draft, when to stream, or which risks to avoid, mastering these basics will make you dangerous in any format.

To understand fantasy strategy, think of it like running a startup: you’re managing limited resources, constantly evaluating market trends, and dealing with competitors who want exactly what you have. You’ll need vision, flexibility, and nerves of steel.

Let’s begin with the heartbeat of every league: the draft.

## 📦 Draft Strategy

The draft is your foundation. A poor draft can bury you before the season starts, while a strong draft sets you up for weeks of flexibility.

I’ll never forget one year in my home league when a manager drafted three QBs in the first six rounds. By Week 2, his roster looked like a salvage yard—top-heavy, brittle, and nearly unfixable. Meanwhile, the winner that year barely reached for anyone. Just made solid, calculated picks using tier rankings and didn’t panic.

### 🧰 Key Concepts

* **Tier-Based Rankings:** Grouping players by projected value range to reduce panic decisions.
* **Positional Scarcity:** Some positions (e.g., TE in football, Catcher in baseball) have fewer reliable options.
* **ADP Awareness:** Average Draft Position helps you find value and avoid reaches.
* **Draft Room Psychology:** Recognizing runs, trends, and traps in live drafts.

> "Don’t chase names. Chase roles, usage, and opportunity."

### 📊 Example: Using Tiers

Instead of drafting the next-best WR because he's top on the list, look at your tier sheet. If four WRs remain in Tier 2, but only one RB is left in Tier 2, prioritize the RB.

| Position | Tier 2 Remaining Players |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| WR       | 4                        |
| RB       | 1                        |

> ✅ Draft RB before a positional run begins.

### 💡 Tools to Use

* Draft Wizard, Sleeper mock rooms
* VORP spreadsheets
* Color-coded tiers with scarcity flags

## 🧱 Roster Construction

Winning rosters have **balance**, **depth**, and **ceiling**. The best managers don’t just fill starting spots—they build toward both stability and upside.

A friend of mine once drafted nothing but boom-or-bust players. By midseason, he was either scoring 200+ or 80 in weekly matchups. He missed playoffs by one game—proving that high ceiling alone doesn’t win championships.

### 🧩 Core Archetypes

| Build Style    | Traits                                    | Risk | Ceiling   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---- | --------- |
| Stars & Scrubs | Elite players + dart throws               | High | High      |
| Balanced       | Equal production across all starters      | Low  | Medium    |
| Upside Hoard   | Targets rookies, sleepers, and volatility | High | Very High |

### 🔁 Real-Life Example

In baseball, if you draft early-round SPs like Gerrit Cole and Spencer Strider, you can wait on bats and load up on high-floor hitters later like Brandon Nimmo or Thairo Estrada.

> 🎯 Draft for ceiling early, floor late.

## 🔁 Streaming & Waivers

Streaming wins leagues. Every format rewards managers who treat in-season moves like a second draft.

My championship team in 2021 was carried not by my stars, but by weekly waiver adds—Zay Jones in Week 17, Anthony Santander in August, and a two-start Joe Ryan that sealed a playoff win. I didn’t “get lucky”—I played the matchups.

### ⚙️ Streaming Tactics

* **Streaming Pitchers (SPs):** Target weak matchups, e.g., vs. Athletics or Rockies on road.
* **Streaming Kickers/Defenses (NFL):** Pick units facing rookie QBs or high-turnover teams.
* **Streaming 3PT Shooters (NBA):** Short-term pickup during favorable schedule weeks.

### 🧮 Streaming Formula (Simple)

```
EV = (Projected Points) – (Replacement Player Points)
```

If a streamer offers 11 pts and your bench guy averages 6, that’s +5 EV for the week.

### 📅 Best Practices

* Track schedule density (NBA/NHL)
* Use FAAB strategically (don’t blow the budget early)
* Have a rotating bench slot

## ⚖️ Risk Management

Risk isn’t just about injury—it’s about uncertainty in role, performance, or availability.

Fantasy baseball managers know the pain of drafting a pitcher with elite stuff… who ends up in Triple-A. In 2022, I spent a 10th-rounder on Matt Brash—pure filth, but no command. Lesson: potential ≠ production.

### 🎲 Player Risk Grid

| Player Profile     | Example Player      | Risk Type          | Risk Level |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Injury History     | Anthony Davis (NBA) | Availability       | High       |
| Rookie Starter     | Jordan Addison      | Usage/Target Share | Medium     |
| Old but Consistent | Justin Turner       | Decline/Regression | Low        |

### 🛡️ Key Principles

* Avoid stacking multiple high-risk players from same team/position
* Diversify build across team ecosystems (e.g., don’t draft 4 Patriots)
* Don’t chase hype unless role + talent + opportunity align

> "Volatility is your friend in DFS. It’s your enemy in season-long redraft."

## 📈 Lineup Optimization

Your drafted team is a starting point. Optimization is the **weekly edge**.

I once benched A.J. Brown for Jakobi Meyers due to weather and matchup. A.J. dropped 3 TDs. I lost by 2 points. But that decision wasn’t wrong—it was sound process. That’s the truth about fantasy: you won’t always get the result you want, but if your process is sharp, it evens out.

### 📅 Weekly Adjustments

* Check matchup stats (e.g., opposing defense vs. position)
* Use weather, pace of play, or park factors
* Bench slumping players even if they have name value

### ⚒️ Tools You Should Use

* Start/Sit Optimizers (FantasyPros, The Fantasy Footballers)
* Player Usage Trackers (Snap counts, Plate Appearances)
* Aggregated Injury Reports (e.g., Rotowire, Underdog Fantasy)

## 🧮 Formulas & EV Examples

### 1. Fantasy Points Over Replacement (FPR)

```
FPR = Projected Points – Replacement Level Points
```

Use this during the draft to compare across positions. If your WR3 projects for 175 points and WR replacement is 145, FPR = +30.

### 2. Weekly Waiver EV

```
Weekly EV = (Starter’s Injury Risk × Backup’s Projection) – FAAB Cost
```

If your RB starter has a 40% injury chance, and the backup would be worth 16 PPG, that’s a 0.4 \* 16 = 6.4 expected value. Compare that to FAAB cost.

### 3. DFS Leverage Score

```
Leverage Score = Projected Ownership % × Projected Value %
```

Low-owned players with high value get you leverage in GPP contests.
