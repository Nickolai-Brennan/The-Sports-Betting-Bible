🌍 1.3.1 – Introduction: The Expanding Fantasy Universe

"Fantasy isn’t just a game. It’s a framework for competition, strategy, and identity."

Fantasy sports have evolved far beyond the days of pen-and-paper football pools or casual baseball rotisserie leagues. Today, the fantasy ecosystem spans every major sport, features diverse league types, and supports multiple layers of engagement — from lighthearted social contests to year-round dynasty franchises with custom rules and data-driven trading.

This explosion of formats has done more than diversify gameplay — it has created a fantasy economy in which structure defines experience. How a league is designed directly determines how players draft, manage, and ultimately compete.

> 📈 A change in format is a change in strategy. What works in redraft might fail in best ball. What wins points leagues may collapse in roto.



🚦 From Casual to Committed: The Fantasy Spectrum

Fantasy formats exist on a spectrum of commitment and complexity. Some offer a one-and-done style of play that resets every week or year, while others demand ongoing management and deep knowledge of future value.

Engagement Level	Format Examples	Manager Traits

Low	Redraft, Best Ball	Casual, time-constrained, social
Medium	Keeper, Points Leagues	Balanced, value-focused, competitive
High	Dynasty, IDP, Auction, Custom	Immersive, strategic, research-driven


Understanding where you fall on that spectrum helps determine what formats will best match your style and schedule.


---

🧭 What Format Offers You Isn’t Just Rules — It’s Identity

Each format not only changes mechanics but also creates a unique identity for the fantasy manager:

Redraft: "Play for now. Reset later."

Dynasty: "Build a legacy. Trade like a GM."

Best Ball: "Draft well once. Let it ride."

DFS: "Outsmart the field today. Cash out tomorrow."


Your format defines your pace, your risk appetite, and your edge. Some formats reward short-term instinct, others reward long-term data modeling. Some are perfect for social leagues, others for solo grinders who track snap shares and breakout trends by the hour.


---

🧱 Format = Strategy Framework

Each fantasy format creates a different layer of strategy. Examples:

Redraft: High emphasis on draft day, injury management, and waiver wire hustle.

Dynasty: Multiyear player valuation, future pick trading, prospect stashing.

DFS: Projection models, salary cap manipulation, ownership leverage.

Keeper: Value drafting with a view toward next season’s ROI.


Even the same scoring settings (e.g., PPR or standard) behave differently when layered into these formats.

> 🔑 Key Point: Before drafting, always ask: What does this format reward?

🧪 How Scoring, Sport, and Format Combine to Shape Strategy

Fantasy sports are a combination of sport, format, and scoring. Change any one of these variables, and your approach must change with it:

Variable	Option Examples	Impact on Strategy

Sport	Football, Baseball, Basketball	Pace, injury risk, season length
Format	Redraft, Dynasty, DFS	Time horizon, roster churn, draft value
Scoring	PPR, Roto, Points, IDP	Category targets, player selection, trade dynamics


The best managers don’t just know their sport — they master their format and its scoring rules.


---

🎮 Platform Ecosystem: Where You Play Also Matters

The tools available to you — and the default rulesets of different platforms — shape gameplay dramatically.

Platform	Notable Features

ESPN	Simple interface, redraft focus
Yahoo	Flexible scoring, strong player projections
Sleeper	Dynasty and keeper-friendly, mobile-forward
Fantrax	Custom leagues, deep minor league support
Underdog	Best ball tournaments, DFS hybrid
DraftKings	Salary cap DFS with high liquidity


Understanding a platform’s limits or features can impact lineup decisions, trade volume, and even your draft flow.

🔢 1.3.2 – Core Fantasy Formats

"One structure. Infinite outcomes. Each format shapes a different game."

The backbone of every fantasy sports league is its format. Whether you're competing for a single-season trophy or managing a five-year dynasty project, the league type you choose determines everything from draft priorities to in-season tactics.

This subsection introduces the six most prevalent fantasy formats, offering structural overviews, strategic goals, and the types of players each format best serves.


---

📅 Redraft: The Reset Button

Summary:
A one-season league that starts fresh each year. No long-term commitments, ideal for new or casual players.

Feature	Redraft Format

Draft	Full redraft each season
Roster Retention	None
Offseason Activity	Minimal
Ideal Player	Casual or time-limited managers


Key Strategy:

---

🏛️ Dynasty: Build a Legacy

Summary:
Long-term format where most or all players are retained each year. It rewards player development, foresight, and patience.

Feature	Dynasty Format

Draft	One-time start-up + annual rookie drafts
Roster Retention	Full (or near full) every season
Offseason Activity	High – trading, scouting, rookie drafts
Ideal Player	Strategic planners and prospect trackers


Key Strategy:
Balance immediate production with long-term upside. Sell aging assets early, accumulate rookie picks, and build depth.


---

🧲 Keeper: Partial Continuity

Summary:
Managers keep a small set of players into the next season. Blends long-term thinking with redraft simplicity.

Feature	Keeper Format

## 1.3.5 – Scoring Systems: The Hidden Engine

### ⚙️ Why It Matters  
Scoring systems are the foundation of every fantasy league. They determine how value is assigned, which players rise or fall, and how managers build rosters. Understanding these systems is not optional — it’s critical to gaining a strategic edge.

---

### 📊 Summary Table: Fantasy Scoring Systems

| Scoring System        | Used In                        | Core Mechanics                                               | Strategic Impact                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📈 Points-Based        | Football, DFS, Basketball        | Stats assigned fixed point values (e.g., 1 pt per 10 rush yds) | Focus on volume; favors consistent producers                  |
| 📊 Rotisserie (Roto)   | Baseball, Basketball, Hockey     | Teams ranked by category totals across season                 | Requires balance across all stats; no punting unless strategic |
| ⚔️ Head-to-Head (H2H) | Football, Basketball, Hockey     | Weekly matchups; win via category or total points             | Schedule and streaming more important than consistency        |
| 🧪 Hybrid / Custom     | Advanced or custom leagues       | Mix of H2H, roto, bonus stats, or efficiency metrics          | Deep rule knowledge gives edge; simulation helps              |

---

### 📈 Points-Based Scoring  
**Used In**:  
- Fantasy Football (most common)  
- DFS formats (across all sports)  
- Basketball and Baseball variants  

**Mechanics**:  
- Each stat has a fixed point value  
- Example: 6 pts per TD, 0.1 pt per rushing yard  

**Strategic Focus**:  
- Draft for raw volume, not balance  
- Floor players are valuable — weekly stability matters  
- Projections and scoring models are essential  

> 💡 Tip: Always read your league’s point values — small tweaks (e.g., 4 vs 6 pts per pass TD) shift player rankings.

---

### 📊 Rotisserie (Roto) Scoring  
**Used In**:  
- Fantasy Baseball  
- Fantasy Basketball  
- Hockey roto leagues  

**Mechanics**:  
- Compete across multiple statistical categories  
- League standings assign points per rank in each category  

**Strategic Focus**:  
- Balance is key — a weak stat category can tank total score  
- Excel tracking and projections help manage pace  
- Category punting is high-risk, high-reward  

> 💡 Tip: Target stats with scarcity (e.g., SB, Saves, Blocks) early in drafts.

---

### ⚔️ Head-to-Head (H2H)  
**Used In**:  
- Fantasy Football  
- Basketball  
- Hockey  

**Mechanics**:  
- Weekly team matchups  
- Win by outscoring (points) or outperforming in categories  

**Strategic Focus**:  
- Streaming is powerful — short-term performance can swing matchups  
- Schedule knowledge is a weapon (e.g., games played, bye weeks)  
- Playoff weeks often override season-long consistency  

> 💡 Tip: Draft for upside, especially late-season schedules.

---

### 🧪 Hybrid and Custom Scoring  
**Used In**:  
- Custom leagues  
- High-skill formats with niche rules  

**Mechanics**:  
- Combine scoring types (e.g., H2H + Roto)  
- Add custom stats (e.g., pressures, clutch hits, hustle plays)  

**Strategic Focus**:  
- Master the rulebook — knowledge edge wins  
- Simulate results pre-draft if possible  
- Find inefficiencies others ignore (e.g., overpowered stat weights)  

> 💡 Tip: In hybrid leagues, use spreadsheets or simulators to test how your build performs across weeks or categories.

---
## 1.3.6 – Draft Planning by Format

### 🎯 The Golden Rule: Format Shapes Everything  
Every fantasy format demands a unique draft mindset. A strategy that wins in redraft may crash in dynasty or best ball. The structure of your league — roster retention, scoring system, waiver rules — should directly influence how you build your team from Round 1 through the final pick.

---

### 📊 Draft Strategy Comparison Table

| Format        | Draft Priority Focus                         | Late-Round Strategy                     | In-Season Dependency          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 🌀 Redraft     | Floor + immediate volume                     | Upside swings, handcuffs                 | High: streaming, waivers      |
| 🧬 Dynasty     | Age, contract length, long-term upside       | Prospects, injured stash candidates      | Medium: trades, development   |
| 🔁 Keeper      | Draft value vs. future cost                  | Rookies, cheap breakouts                 | High: planning for next year  |
| 💥 Best Ball   | Spike weeks, depth, stacking                 | Boom-bust WRs, backup RBs                | None: draft-only              |
| 💰 DFS         | Salary value, projection modeling            | Contrarian picks, volatility             | Very High: single-day format  |
| ⚔️ H2H         | Weekly matchup leverage                      | Schedule exploitation, streaming FLEX    | High: matchup plays crucial   |
| 📈 Roto        | Category balance, stat accumulation          | Category fillers, stat stability         | Medium: early correction wins |

### 🛠 Universal Draft Concepts

| Term                | Definition                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ADP**             | Average Draft Position — tracks where players are going across leagues     |
| **VORP**            | Value Over Replacement Player — surplus vs. average-level starter          |
| **Tiering**         | Grouping players into performance bands, not fixed ranks                   |
| **Positional Scarcity** | Thin positions (e.g., TE, RP) get premium due to drop-off in value     |
| **Roster Construction** | Structural balance — floor, upside, depth, positional fill             |

> 💡 Tip: Use tier-based drafting to avoid positional cliffs.

---

### 🌀 Redraft Blueprint  
**Goal**: Win now

- **Early Rounds**: High-floor volume players (e.g., bell-cow RBs, WR1s)
- **Middle Rounds**: Breakout candidates and flex-depth
- **Late Rounds**: Lottery tickets, handcuffs, streamers
- **Key Metric**: Early season opportunity + clear usage

**In-Season Tools**: Waiver wire activity, start/sit models, matchup analysis

---

### 🧬 Dynasty Blueprint  
**Goal**: Long-term ceiling + roster sustainability

- **Rounds 1–3**: Elite, young core (under 26 ideal)
- **Rounds 4–8**: Immediate contributors + ascending assets
- **Rounds 9+**: Stashes, rookies, injury redshirts, deep shots

**Key Concept**: Balance production curve with trade leverage  
**Strategic Note**: WRs age better than RBs — draft longevity

---

### 🔁 Keeper Blueprint  
**Goal**: Build value, not just points

- **Early Rounds**: Stars at a discount = core keepers
- **Middle Rounds**: Projected breakouts with keeper appeal
- **Late Rounds**: Target high-upside rookies (low-cost keepers)

**Decision Framework**:
- Keeper Cost vs. Draft Value
- Multi-season outlook
- Positional inflation in later drafts

---

### 💥 Best Ball Blueprint  
**Goal**: Maximize weekly ceiling, ignore floor

- **Early Rounds**: Correlated stacks (QB + WR/TE)
- **Middle Rounds**: High-variance profiles (WR2s with big-play roles)
- **Late Rounds**: Volume dart throws, 2nd-stringers with injury upside

**Draft Rule**: Build for range of outcomes, not safe weekly floor  
> 💡 Pro Tip: 3 QBs, 6+ WRs, and redundancy at fragile positions is key

---

### 💰 DFS Blueprint  
**Goal**: Win on projections and leverage

- **Key Components**: Salary cost efficiency + matchup exploitation
- **Build Types**: Cash lineups (floor) vs. GPP (tournament spike builds)
- **Differentiation**: Contrarian picks separate winners

**Tools to Use**:
- Optimizer projections
- Vegas lines / Over-Under
- Player prop variance

---

### ⚔️ H2H League Blueprint  
**Goal**: Win matchups weekly, qualify for playoffs

- **Draft Traits**: Volatility is a feature — not a bug  
- **Schedule Awareness**: Players with extra games during playoffs are valuable  
- **Position Flexibility**: Multi-position players solve bye-week problems  

> 💡 Plan 3–4 weeks ahead for streaming options.

---

### 📈 Roto League Blueprint  
**Goal**: Balanced season-long accumulation

- **Draft Planning**: Target category caps per position (e.g., 300 HR, 90 SB)  
- **Scarcity Watch**: Steals, saves, and low ERA arms go early  
- **Punting?**: Only when strategic and compensated elsewhere

**Roster Focus**:
- Starters with high durability  
- Players contributing across 4–5 stat categories  
- Relief pitching and speed are category levers

---

## 1.3.7 – Cross-Format Draft Tools

### 🧰 Why Tools Matter Across All Formats  
Whether you’re building a dynasty roster or entering a daily fantasy contest, success hinges on mastering draft tools that allow you to evaluate players **within the context of your format.** Rankings alone aren’t enough. You need contextual value — adjusted for scoring, positional depth, and strategic needs.

---

---

### 🔍 Tool Use Case Examples

#### 🌀 Redraft League  
- **ADP vs. ECR** (Expert Consensus Rankings) gap = market inefficiencies  
- **Tier breaks** help avoid positional cliffs  
- Use **positional scarcity** to draft TE early if drop-off is steep

#### 🧬 Dynasty  
- **VORP** adjusted by age and breakout curve  
- Combine **tiering** with career arc projection  
- Long-term positional **roster balance** over weekly upside

#### 💥 Best Ball  
- **Stacking matrix** by team schedule + ADP overlap  
- Use **roster templates** (e.g., 3QBs, 6WRs) to structure drafts  
- Draft **high-variance players** at the flex

#### 💰 DFS  
- **Projection models** + salary value = key to lineup ROI  
- **Stacking + leverage** = game theory for contrarian wins  
- Use **player prop odds** for median + ceiling projection

---

### 📐 Tiered Rankings vs. Flat Rankings

| Approach        | Description                                  | Advantage                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Flat Rankings   | Single 1–200 list, often unadjusted for format | Simple but lacks strategic context |
| Tiered Rankings | Cluster players into similar expected value bands | More adaptive, helps with flexibility |

> 💡 Tier-based drafting prevents panic during draft runs and helps you extract value across positions.

---

### 📈 VORP (Value Over Replacement Player)

- **Purpose**: Quantify how much better a player is than a typical starter
- **Formula**:  
  `VORP = (Projected Player Points) - (Replacement Player Points)`
- **Use it to**:  
  - Prioritize positions where drop-off is sharp  
  - Identify undervalued mid-round players

| Format     | Ideal Structure Example                     |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Best Ball  | 3 QBs, 5 RBs, 6 WRs, 2 TEs                   |
| Redraft    | 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, Bench Depth  |
| Dynasty    | Core under-26 players + 3+ stash spots       |
| DFS (GPP)  | 1 QB, 1 RB/WR stack, 1 contrarian pick        |

> Tip: Don’t chase positional balance in early rounds unless your scoring demands it.

---

### 📅 Bye Week Matrix and Draft Balance

Use a **bye week grid** to avoid overlapping bye weeks in key positions, especially:

- QBs in Superflex leagues
- TEs and DSTs in Redraft
- RBs with heavy usage profiles

> 🚫 Don’t auto-avoid bye weeks — just ensure coverage.

---

### 📝 Summary Checklist: Draft Tools You Should Use

✔ Use **tiered rankings** over flat lists  
✔ Apply **VORP** to measure true positional value  
✔ Build **roster templates** to guide structure  
✔ Leverage **stacking** where applicable  
✔ Track **ADP gaps** for bargain picks  
✔ Use **projections + scoring multipliers** for custom leagues  
✔ Cross-check for **bye overlap**, especially in single-QB formats

## 1.3.8 – Redraft League Blueprint

### 🎯 Goal: Win Now

Redraft leagues are seasonal formats where teams start fresh each year. There are no long-term roster holdovers, which means every decision you make — from draft day to Week 17 — is geared toward **immediate value and short-term payoff**.

> 🧠 Philosophy: Prioritize current-season production, secure weekly starters, and exploit short-term inefficiencies.

## 1.3.9 – Dynasty League Blueprint

### 🧭 Goal: Build for Long-Term Success

Dynasty leagues simulate real-world team building. Instead of drafting a new team every year, managers retain most or all players across seasons. The goal shifts from winning now to creating a **sustainable championship window** over multiple years.

> 📌 Strategy focus: Long-term value, prospect development, trade equity, and age curve mastery.

### 🛠 Dynasty Draft Structure

| Round Range | Objective                          | Targets                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1–3         | Anchor pieces for 2–4 years        | Elite WRs, young QBs, foundational RBs   |
| 4–8         | Balanced upside + early production | Year 1 starters, young high-floor players|
| 9–15        | Depth and value accumulation       | Rookies, breakouts, role players         |
| 16–25       | Stashes and developmental picks    | Handcuffs, 2nd/3rd-year breakouts        |

---

### 📈 Age-Based Value Trends

| Position | Peak Years       | Strategy Implication                          |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| QB       | 25–33            | Build around long-term starters               |
| RB       | 22–26            | Sell after Year 3 unless elite                |
| WR       | 24–29            | Safer long-term investment                    |
| TE       | 25–31            | Late breakout potential; long careers         |

> 🧠 Rule of Thumb: WRs > RBs for core build; RBs = final title piece.

📊 Example Trade Window Table:

| Situation               | Trade Move                        |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Rebuilding              | Sell Kelce for picks + rookie TE  |
| Contending              | Buy Ekeler for WR4 + future 2nd   |
| Stuck in middle         | Pivot to 2025 picks + youth       |

## 1.3.10 – Best Ball, DFS & Specialty Format Strategy

### 🎯 Best Ball: Draft It and Forget It

Best Ball leagues simplify the in-season grind. There are no waivers, no trades, and no start/sit decisions. The platform automatically starts your highest-scoring players each week. Success is determined entirely by draft-day performance and depth construction.

#### 🧠 Key Strategy Points:
- **Draft for Upside**: Focus on spike-week players who can win individual weeks.
- **Depth Over Stability**: Injuries are unmanageable, so draft more at volatile positions (WR, RB).
- **Stacking Wins**: Combine QBs with WRs/TEs to maximize ceiling.

#### ✅ Draft Tips:
- Draft 2–3 QBs, 5–6 RBs, 7+ WRs, and 2–3 TEs in most formats.
- Stack mid/late-round pass catchers with your QB.
- Avoid redundancy; seek high variance from bench players.

#### 📈 Best Ball Formula:

'''Projected ROI = (Spike Weeks × Team Ceiling Multiplier) / Draft Capital Used'''
#### 📋 Example Stacking Table

| QB           | WR Stack       | Late Round Option |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Josh Allen   | Stefon Diggs   | Dalton Kincaid    |
| Jalen Hurts  | DeVonta Smith  | Quez Watkins      |
| Jordan Love  | Romeo Doubs    | Luke Musgrave     |

---

### 💰 DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports): Short-Term Mastery

DFS formats offer daily or weekly contests with a salary cap. Players must build lineups within budget constraints and compete in contests ranging from double-ups to large-field GPPs (guaranteed prize pools).

#### 🧠 Key Strategy Points
- **Value Identification**: Use projections vs. price to find value plays.
- **Stacking and Correlation**: Stack QBs with pass catchers to increase upside.
- **Game Environment Matters**: Focus on matchups, pace, and Vegas totals.

#### ✅ DFS Contest Tips
- In **cash games**: Focus on floor, avoid risk.
- In **GPPs**: Embrace volatility and unique lineups.
- Watch **late news** for injury-replacement plays.

#### 📊 DFS Tools to Leverage
- Optimizer software (e.g., FantasyLabs, RotoGrinders)
- Projected ownership %
- Ceiling/floor metrics

---

### 🧪 Specialty Formats: Embrace the Edge

These include niche formats like Guillotine Leagues, Survivor, Vampire Leagues, or Multi-sport formats.

#### 📉 Guillotine Leagues
- **Mechanic**: Lowest-scoring team each week is eliminated.
- **Strategy**: Play safe early, pivot to upside late.
- **Waivers**: Explosive, as cut players re-enter the pool.

#### 🧛 Vampire Leagues
- **Mechanic**: One team starts with no draft, can steal players after wins.
- **Strategy**: Avoid losses vs. vampire team; vampire drafts upside from free agency.

#### 🧩 Multi-Sport/Combo Leagues
- Blend multiple formats or sports into one contest (e.g., football + basketball).
- Deep rules and scoring quirks create complex strategic layers.

---

### 🧾 Summary Checklist: Winning in Specialty Formats

- ✔ In Best Ball, spike weeks > consistency.
- ✔ In DFS, always stack for ceiling and correlate plays.
- ✔ In Guillotine/Survivor, minimize risk early and pivot to upside late.
- ✔ In Vampire, stream weekly and play defense vs. vampire.
- ✔ Know rules intimately — edge comes from mastering the margins.

- ## 1.3.11 – Universal Draft Checklist

A great draft doesn’t start when you're on the clock — it starts with structure, preparation, and alignment with your league format. No matter what kind of fantasy league you’re playing in, the fundamentals of draft success remain constant across formats.

### ✅ Pre-Draft Evaluation

- **Know Your Format**: PPR, Superflex, Roto, Points, Keeper, IDP, etc.
- **Understand League Settings**: Scoring rules, roster size, positional limits.
- **Research ADP Trends**: Adjust for your platform and draft slot.
- **Map Bye Weeks**: Avoid overstacking bye-heavy positions early.

### 🧠 Strategic Tiering

- **Use Tiers, Not Just Ranks**: Cluster players with similar value to prevent reaching.
- **Color-Code Tiers**: Visually track positional drop-offs during the draft.
- **Break Ties with Format Fit**: Does the player’s profile align with your league type?

### 📊 Project Season Flow by Format

| Format        | Focus                         | Draft Priorities                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Redraft       | Weekly ceiling, early usage   | Stability + waiver agility              |
| Dynasty       | Age curve, development        | Youth, breakout trajectory              |
| Best Ball     | Spike weeks, no waivers       | Stacking, upside, depth                 |
| DFS           | Matchups + value efficiency   | Game theory + projections               |
| Keeper        | Year-over-year cost value     | Late-round breakout targets             |

### 🧩 Positional Construction Guide

- **RBs**: Scarce in early rounds; opportunity-driven late.
- **WRs**: Depth-rich but tier gaps matter in PPR.
- **QBs**: Wait unless in Superflex or 2QB formats.
- **TEs**: Either grab elite or wait and stream.
- **DST/K**: Late-round targets or stream from Week 1.

### 📋 Final Round Priorities

- **Lottery Tickets**: Rookie RBs, #2 WRs with upside, injury handcuffs.
- **Early-Season Volume**: Players likely to start hot before role shifts.
- **Stream Targets**: Defenses or fringe starters with great Week 1 matchup.

### 🔁 Contingency Planning

- **Have Backup Picks Ready**: 2–3 alternates for each upcoming turn.
- **Mock Draft from Your Slot**: Replicate real decisions under pressure.
- **Anticipate Runs**: Be ready to zig when your league zags.

### 🧾 Summary Checklist

- ✔ Understand format, rules, and roster depth
- ✔ Tier players by value, not just rank
- ✔ Build a draft board tailored to scoring system
- ✔ Draft flexibility + variance based on league type
- ✔ Target upside late, floor early
- ✔ Use every bench spot intentionally
- ✔ Stay calm, adapt, and draft for the season *you’re actually playing*

--- 

  ## 1.3.12 – Section Ending: Formats Shape Everything

Fantasy sports are more than just player names and stats — they are games defined by their structure. The format you choose is the lens through which all decisions are made: how you draft, when you trade, what you prioritize, and how you win.

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **Know Your Format First**  
  Strategy always begins with format. Redraft, dynasty, points, roto — each demands a unique approach.

- **Align Player Evaluation to Scoring**  
  A player’s value changes drastically between formats. Understand how scoring inflates or deflates value.

- **Draft for the Season You’re Playing**  
  Best ball is about spikes. Dynasty is about age. Roto is about balance. H2H is about volatility. Play to the format’s strengths.

- **Adaptability is Your Edge**  
  Whether it’s keeper rules, auction dynamics, or hybrid scoring quirks — the more flexible you are, the more edges you’ll find.

### 📘 What’s Next: Section 1.4 – Managing Your Roster

Now that we’ve covered how to draft across different formats, it’s time to shift focus to what happens *after* draft day. In Section 1.4, we’ll explore:

- Waiver wire domination
- Trade negotiation frameworks
- Weekly start/sit logic
- In-season analytics and timing

> Drafting is just the beginning. Championships are won by managers who adapt and evolve.
