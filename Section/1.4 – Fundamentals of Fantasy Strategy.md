# Section 1.4 – Fundamentals of Fantasy Strategy

## 🧠 From Gut to Gameplan: How Strategy Defines Success

Fantasy sports is a strange cocktail of spreadsheets, instincts, and suffering. Everyone starts with the same ingredients—draft picks, a waiver wire, and blind hope—but it's the ones who mix their data with discipline who come out on top.

You aren’t just playing a game. You’re **running a small sports hedge fund** where player shares rise and fall by the hour. You’ll ride hot streaks like a drunk gambler and drop veterans like expired milk. Strategy is what keeps you sane.

> “The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubt, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.”
> —Charles Bukowski

Fantasy success doesn’t require perfection—just persistent edges. One more calculated risk than your rival. One less emotional mistake. And the stones to start a backup tight end on Monday night.

## 📦 Draft Strategy

Draft day is where every manager shows who they really are. The spreadsheet samurai, the highlight hunter, the panicker, the prophet.

I once saw a guy draft three defenses before Round 10. His reasoning? “That’s how I won in 2016.” Nostalgia is not a strategy. Use data. Draft in tiers. Watch the board. Know your league’s tendencies better than your ex’s favorite excuses.

### 1.4.1 – Understanding League Rules & Scoring

Every strategy is built on structure. If you don’t know the scoring system, you’re flying blind. Does your league reward receptions? Is it roto or head-to-head? Are there bonus points for 100-yard games? All of this changes value.

### 1.4.2 – Setting Category Targets & Benchmarks

Reverse-engineer your win. In roto, identify the thresholds needed to finish top 3 in each category. In points leagues, calculate average weekly scoring output of playoff teams. Then draft with those benchmarks in mind.

### 1.4.3 – Tiered Draft Boards

Drafting with tiers helps you avoid positional runs and emotional swings. It’s not just about who’s next—it’s about who’s in the *last group of reliable options* at that position.

> Example: If only one Tier 2 RB is left but four WRs remain, take the RB before the cliff hits.

### 1.4.4 – Building Watchlists (Sleepers & Breakouts)

Prepare 3 lists:

* Sleepers (ADP > 150 who could breakout)
* Post-Hype Bouncebacks (players who burned people last year)
* Depth Chart Risers (young players with minimal competition)

These are your lottery tickets.

### 1.4.5 – Mock Drafting & Scenario Testing

Mock like a maniac. Don’t just test ideal starts—force yourself into corner cases: What if you start WR/WR? What if your preferred QB gets sniped?

### 1.4.6 – Pre-Draft Checklist

* ✅ League settings reviewed
* ✅ Targets by category defined
* ✅ Tier sheet finalized
* ✅ Backup plans ready for each position
* ✅ FAAB setup understood (if applicable)
* ✅ Draft room tech + snacks + backup internet

You laugh—but one guy in my league lost connection mid-draft and autodrafted two kickers. Draft prep is war. Bring your weapons.

### 📊 Example Table: Tier-Based Draft Pressure

| Position | Tier 2 Remaining | Panic Meter | Suggested Move        |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| WR       | 4                | 😐 Low      | Wait and pivot later  |
| RB       | 1                | 🔥 High     | Draft before drop-off |

> ✅ Draft RB before a positional run begins. Protect against scarcity.

### 💡 Tools for Draft Combat

* Draft Wizard or FantasyPros Assistant
* ADP charts by site (ESPN vs. Yahoo vs. Underdog)
* Custom tier-based Google Sheet with conditional formatting

### 🧠 Strategy Formula: VORP (Value Over Replacement Player)

```
VORP = Player Projection – Replacement Level Projection
```

This lets you compare cross-position values. A WR projected for 230 pts with a replacement WR at 190 has a VORP of +40.

## 🧱 Roster Construction

## 🧱 Roster Construction

Winning rosters have **balance**, **depth**, and **ceiling**. The best managers don’t just fill starting spots—they build toward both stability and upside.

A friend of mine once drafted nothing but boom-or-bust players. By midseason, he was either scoring 200+ or 80 in weekly matchups. He missed playoffs by one game—proving that high ceiling alone doesn’t win championships.

### 🧩 Core Archetypes

| Build Style    | Traits                                    | Risk | Ceiling   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---- | --------- |
| Stars & Scrubs | Elite players + dart throws               | High | High      |
| Balanced       | Equal production across all starters      | Low  | Medium    |
| Upside Hoard   | Targets rookies, sleepers, and volatility | High | Very High |

### 🔁 Real-Life Example

In baseball, if you draft early-round SPs like Gerrit Cole and Spencer Strider, you can wait on bats and load up on high-floor hitters later like Brandon Nimmo or Thairo Estrada.

> 🎯 Draft for ceiling early, floor late.

## 🔁 Streaming & Waivers

Streaming wins leagues. Every format rewards managers who treat in-season moves like a second draft.

My championship team in 2021 was carried not by my stars, but by weekly waiver adds—Zay Jones in Week 17, Anthony Santander in August, and a two-start Joe Ryan that sealed a playoff win. I didn’t “get lucky”—I played the matchups.

### ⚙️ Streaming Tactics

* **Streaming Pitchers (SPs):** Target weak matchups, e.g., vs. Athletics or Rockies on road.
* **Streaming Kickers/Defenses (NFL):** Pick units facing rookie QBs or high-turnover teams.
* **Streaming 3PT Shooters (NBA):** Short-term pickup during favorable schedule weeks.

### 🧮 Streaming Formula (Simple)

```
EV = (Projected Points) – (Replacement Player Points)
```

If a streamer offers 11 pts and your bench guy averages 6, that’s +5 EV for the week.

### 📅 Best Practices

* Track schedule density (NBA/NHL)
* Use FAAB strategically (don’t blow the budget early)
* Have a rotating bench slot

## ⚖️ Risk Management

Risk isn’t just about injury—it’s about uncertainty in role, performance, or availability.

Fantasy baseball managers know the pain of drafting a pitcher with elite stuff… who ends up in Triple-A. In 2022, I spent a 10th-rounder on Matt Brash—pure filth, but no command. Lesson: potential ≠ production.

### 🎲 Player Risk Grid

| Player Profile     | Example Player      | Risk Type          | Risk Level |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Injury History     | Anthony Davis (NBA) | Availability       | High       |
| Rookie Starter     | Jordan Addison      | Usage/Target Share | Medium     |
| Old but Consistent | Justin Turner       | Decline/Regression | Low        |

### 🛡️ Key Principles

* Avoid stacking multiple high-risk players from same team/position
* Diversify build across team ecosystems (e.g., don’t draft 4 Patriots)
* Don’t chase hype unless role + talent + opportunity align

> "Volatility is your friend in DFS. It’s your enemy in season-long redraft."

## 📈 Lineup Optimization

Your drafted team is a starting point. Optimization is the **weekly edge**.

I once benched A.J. Brown for Jakobi Meyers due to weather and matchup. A.J. dropped 3 TDs. I lost by 2 points. But that decision wasn’t wrong—it was sound process. That’s the truth about fantasy: you won’t always get the result you want, but if your process is sharp, it evens out.

### 📅 Weekly Adjustments

* Check matchup stats (e.g., opposing defense vs. position)
* Use weather, pace of play, or park factors
* Bench slumping players even if they have name value

### ⚒️ Tools You Should Use

* Start/Sit Optimizers (FantasyPros, The Fantasy Footballers)
* Player Usage Trackers (Snap counts, Plate Appearances)
* Aggregated Injury Reports (e.g., Rotowire, Underdog Fantasy)

## 🧮 Formulas & EV Examples

### 1. Fantasy Points Over Replacement (FPR)

```
FPR = Projected Points – Replacement Level Points
```

Use this during the draft to compare across positions. If your WR3 projects for 175 points and WR replacement is 145, FPR = +30.

### 2. Weekly Waiver EV

```
Weekly EV = (Starter’s Injury Risk × Backup’s Projection) – FAAB Cost
```

If your RB starter has a 40% injury chance, and the backup would be worth 16 PPG, that’s a 0.4 \* 16 = 6.4 expected value. Compare that to FAAB cost.

### 3. DFS Leverage Score

```
Leverage Score = Projected Ownership % × Projected Value %
```

Low-owned players with high value get you leverage in GPP contests.
