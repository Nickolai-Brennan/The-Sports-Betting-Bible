## 🧠 From Gut to Gameplan: How Strategy Defines Success

Fantasy sports is a strange cocktail of spreadsheets, instincts, and suffering. Everyone starts with the same ingredients—draft picks, a waiver wire, and blind hope—but it's the ones who mix their data with discipline who come out on top.

You aren’t just playing a game. You’re **running a small sports hedge fund** where player shares rise and fall by the hour. You’ll ride hot streaks like a drunk gambler and drop veterans like expired milk. Strategy is what keeps you sane.

> “The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubt, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.”
> —Charles Bukowski

Fantasy success doesn’t require perfection—just persistent edges. One more calculated risk than your rival. One less emotional mistake. And the stones to start a backup tight end on Monday night.


### 1.4.1 – Understanding League Rules & Scoring

Before you touch a single player rank, mock draft, or trade calculator — you must understand the scaffolding your league is built on.

Fantasy scoring rules are not suggestions. They are the **market structure** — and value is always context-driven. A 1,200-yard RB in standard scoring is useful. That same RB with 60 receptions in a PPR league? Now he’s elite.

---

#### 🧾 Key Rule Components to Understand

| Category               | Example or Implication                                       |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scoring Format         | PPR, Half-PPR, Standard, Points, Roto                        |
| Roster Positions       | 2 RBs? 3 WRs? 1 Flex? Superflex?                             |
| Waiver System          | FAAB, Rolling Waivers, Open Waivers                         |
| Bench Depth            | More bench = more stashing = more strategy                  |
| Trade Rules            | Veto process? Deadlines? Review period?                     |
| Playoff Format         | Week 14–17? Bye weeks matter.                               |
| Bonus Points           | 100-yard bonus? 40-yard TD bonus?                           |
| Defensive Scoring (NFL)| D/ST sacks, INTs, points allowed — massive variation        |
| Stat Providers         | Yahoo, ESPN, Sleeper all differ slightly                    |

---

#### 🔍 Why Scoring Systems Matter

Let’s say your league gives **6 points for passing TDs** instead of the standard 4. That instantly boosts the value of pocket QBs like Jared Goff and Tua Tagovailoa. Conversely, leagues that award **1 point per 10 rushing yards** and **0.5 PPR** favor dual-threat RBs and slot WRs.

In basketball, leagues that count **double-doubles/triple-doubles as bonuses** elevate bigs like Domantas Sabonis or Nikola Jokic even higher.

---

#### 🧠 Strategy Implications

- **PPR leagues** reward players who catch short passes (slot WRs, pass-catching RBs).
- **Half-PPR** is more balanced — volume still matters, but touchdowns reign.
- **Roto formats** require balance across multiple categories — you can’t ignore steals or blocks in NBA, or saves in MLB.
- **Points leagues** flatten positional value — just chase raw production.
- **Superflex formats** push QBs way up draft boards — you may need 2 in the first 3 rounds.
- **IDP leagues** change your draft entirely — tackles matter more than sacks in most settings.

---

#### 💥 Real-World Example

Two managers in the same player pool:
- **Manager A** plays in full PPR and targets Keenan Allen, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Christian Kirk.
- **Manager B** is in standard scoring and drafts Nick Chubb, Mike Evans, and Derrick Henry.

Both made smart choices — for their format.

---

#### 🛠️ Action Checklist

1. ✅ Read the full league settings — every word.
2. ✅ Understand scoring modifiers and bonuses.
3. ✅ Look at last year’s top scorers — any surprises?
4. ✅ Check for platform quirks (e.g., dual eligibility, default projections).
5. ✅ Build your draft board **specifically** for your format.

> 🧠 Strategy doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It exists within rules. Know them better than anyone else.
---
### 1.4.2 – Setting Category Targets & Benchmarks

You can't win what you can't measure. Every fantasy sport and format has underlying statistical benchmarks that separate playoff contenders from middle-tier mediocrity. Whether you're in rotisserie, points, or H2H, you must reverse-engineer the output required to win.

> 🎯 Strategy isn’t about chasing points — it’s about predicting how many you need.

---

#### 📊 Reverse-Engineering Category Goals

In rotisserie (roto), your goal is to **rank highly in as many categories as possible**. That means identifying what it takes to finish top 3 in each one.

Example: In a 12-team roto baseball league

| Category    | Target to Finish Top 3 | Notes                              |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Home Runs   | 280+                   | Requires multiple 30+ HR bats      |
| Stolen Bases| 110+                   | Positional scarcity at SS/OF      |
| ERA         | Under 3.75             | Don’t chase Ks at ERA's expense   |
| Saves       | 75–90                  | Two closers + midseason adds      |
| Batting Avg | .270+                  | Don’t punt BA in early rounds     |

In fantasy football, a points league might require:

| Position | Weekly Avg for Playoff Teams | Notes                             |
|----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| QB       | 20+                          | Dual-threats have higher ceilings |
| RB       | 15–17                        | Volume > efficiency               |
| WR       | 12–14                        | Consistency wins matchups         |
| FLEX     | 10–12                        | Floor players matter              |

---

#### 🧠 Why This Matters

- Drafting blindly by “value” ignores **roster construction targets**.
- You don’t need five 20-HR guys. You might need **two 40-HR hitters**.
- In H2H, you might choose to **punt blocks or steals** in basketball to dominate assists, threes, and scoring.

---

#### 📐 Target Categories Based on Format

| Format        | Benchmark Focus                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Roto          | Seasonal category totals (balance wins)  |
| H2H Categories| Weekly category wins (volatility-friendly) |
| Points League | Total raw output (volume > efficiency)   |
| DFS           | Ceiling variance (spike weeks)           |

---

#### 🧮 Building Target Profiles by Position

In fantasy baseball, for example:

| Position | HR Target | SB Target | Notes                          |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 1B       | 30+       | 0–5       | Power-first                    |
| SS       | 15–20     | 15–30     | Combo players (power + speed)  |
| OF       | 20–30     | 10–20     | Multi-stat potential           |
| RP       | Saves     | ERA/WHIP  | Need 2 closers or 1 elite guy  |

In fantasy football:

| RB Tier     | Touches/Week | PPR Points | Player Type         |
|-------------|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| Elite       | 20+          | 18+        | CMC, Ekeler, Barkley |
| Floor RB    | 12–15        | 10–12      | James Conner type     |
| Handcuff    | <10          | <6         | Stash + injury upside |

---

#### 🛠️ Benchmark Tools & Tips

* Use last season’s league history to extract average playoff team outputs.
* Track per-position points to expose underperforming categories early.
* Roto managers should graph their progress by category weekly.
* Points leaguers should simulate weekly outcomes during draft prep.

---

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

> "If you don’t know what a winning stat line looks like — you won’t draft one."

Set targets. Draft toward them. Track your team weekly with those goals in mind. That’s how casual players become contenders.

---

### 1.4.3 – Tiered Draft Boards

Draft rankings tell you **who**, but tiers tell you **when**.

Most managers draft with a top-200 list and hope for value. Smart players draft with **tiered clusters**—groups of similarly projected players at each position. This approach lets you pivot mid-draft, avoid panicked picks, and capitalize on positional cliffs.

> 📉 A tier drop is when the last player of a reliable group is about to go. Miss it, and you overpay next round.

---

#### 📐 What Is Tier-Based Drafting?

A draft tier is a **group of players with similar expected value**. They're not ranked linearly. Instead, players are placed in performance "buckets."

Example: WR Tier 2

- Amon-Ra St. Brown
- Jaylen Waddle
- DeVonta Smith

These WRs may be ranked 9th, 10th, and 12th—but drafting any of them serves the same strategic purpose.

---

#### 📊 Why Use Tiers?

| Advantage                  | Impact                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Avoids Positional Runs     | Don’t get trapped chasing a position just because others are |
| Informs Draft Timing       | Take the last player in a tier before a drop-off       |
| Cross-Positional Comparison| Know when to pivot between WR, RB, TE based on scarcity |

---

#### 🧩 Sample Tier Chart (Fantasy Football – WR Example)

| Tier | Players                                           | Strategy                                        |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Justin Jefferson, Ja’Marr Chase, CeeDee Lamb     | Lock in elite WR1s early                        |
| 2    | Amon-Ra, Waddle, Higgins, Smith                  | Anchor WR2, watch for end-of-tier cliff         |
| 3    | Ridley, Metcalf, McLaurin, Christian Watson      | Mid-round upside + injury concerns              |
| 4    | Lockett, Pittman, Mike Williams, Diontae Johnson| Volume + game script + schedule dependent       |

> 💡 If you're picking late in a round and see Tier 2 drying up, reach slightly to avoid landing in Tier 3.

---

#### 🧮 Positional Scarcity & Tiers

Scarcity refers to how fast a position dries up.

- **QB:** Deep in redraft. Tiering helps identify late-round starters.
- **TE:** Shallow. Tier drops after elite options are steep.
- **RB:** Injuries & usage matter more than "talent tier."
- **WR:** Volume and targets help maintain tier depth.

---

#### 💻 Tools for Building Tiers

| Tool/Resource           | Use Case                                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| FantasyPros Tiered Rankings | Ready-made tiers per format (PPR, STD, Dynasty) |
| Draft Wizard            | Imports your tiers into mock/simulations   |
| Google Sheets           | Build custom tiers and color-code by risk   |
| ADP Consensus           | Highlight values slipping across tiers     |

---

#### 📈 Draft Decision Tree (Simplified)

1. Check how many players remain in your current tier at each position.
2. Compare drop-off size to next tier.
3. Make pick that maximizes value **before** your next turn.

> Example: If 4 Tier 3 WRs are left but only 1 Tier 2 TE remains, take the TE.

---

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

> “Drafting by rank is linear. Drafting by tier is strategic.”

Tiers give you flexibility, precision, and peace of mind. They tell you when to act—not just who to pick.

--- 

### 1.4.4 – Building Watchlists (Sleepers & Breakouts)

The draft is just the beginning. Your **watchlist** is your radar system—scanning for undervalued assets, breakout potential, and opportunity surges that others miss.

Top-tier fantasy players don’t rely on rankings alone. They forecast **growth curves**, **depth chart volatility**, and **market inefficiencies**. A good watchlist makes you early. Being early makes you profitable.

---

#### 🧪 Why Watchlists Matter

| Feature                  | Strategic Value                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Sleepers                 | Provide high ROI from late-round or undrafted picks |
| Breakouts                | Identify league-winning upside                      |
| Bouncebacks              | Target post-hype values at discount                 |
| Injury Replacements      | Prioritize stashes with clear upside paths          |

---

#### 📂 Watchlist Categories

1. **Sleepers**
   - Late-round players (ADP > 150) with path to increased role
   - Often buried behind aging/injury-prone starters
   - Win leagues when they "pop" early

2. **Breakouts**
   - Young or ascending players on verge of top-24/top-12 production
   - Require usage + talent + team context

3. **Post-Hype Bouncebacks**
   - Disappointed in prior year but still have opportunity + talent
   - Market value often lower than production potential

4. **Depth Chart Risers**
   - One injury away from 10+ touches/targets
   - Particularly valuable in RB, WR3, or TE situations

---

#### 🔍 Evaluation Formula: Breakout Probability Index (BPI)

Use this simple weighted model to assess breakout potential:

``` 
BPI = (Talent Score × 0.4) + (Opportunity Score × 0.4) + (Team Environment × 0.2)
```

- Talent Score: 1–10 (film, metrics, pedigree)
- Opportunity Score: 1–10 (depth chart, target share, snap %)
- Team Environment: 1–10 (pace, scoring, stability)

> A BPI ≥ 8.0 indicates breakout priority. Anything 6.5–7.9 belongs on a short leash.

---

#### 🧩 Example: 2023 Breakout RB Watchlist

| Player         | Talent | Opportunity | Team Env | BPI   |
|----------------|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Jaylen Warren  | 8      | 7           | 7        | 7.4   |
| Tyjae Spears   | 7      | 6           | 8        | 6.8   |
| Roschon Johnson | 7     | 8           | 6        | 7.2   |
| Zamir White    | 6      | 8           | 7        | 6.8   |

---

#### 📈 Custom Watchlist Sheet Template (Recommended Columns)

| Player Name | Team | Position | Bye Week | ADP | Depth Rank | Injury Ahead? | Last 3 Weeks | Roster % | Notes |
|-------------|------|----------|----------|-----|------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|-------|

Keep this Google Sheet updated weekly. Color-code by position or BPI score.

---

#### 🧠 Weekly Watchlist Actions

| Action            | Purpose                                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Add/Drop Tiers    | Re-rank sleepers based on usage trends or injury   |
| Trade Targets     | Highlight undervalued bouncebacks                  |
| Schedule Scan     | Identify streaming value 2–3 weeks ahead           |
| Discord/Reddit Scan | Gauge community sentiment shifts on players      |

> ⚠️ Don’t just copy waiver wire articles. Use your watchlist to anticipate moves **before** the crowd reacts.

---

#### 💬 Quick Tips for Building a Killer Watchlist

- Target rookies with elite traits but uncertain roles
- Track 1st-team usage in preseason and camp reports
- Follow beat reporters for snap/target distribution
- Prioritize players with “first man in” opportunity in shallow depth charts

---

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

> “Waivers win championships. Your watchlist is how you win waivers.”

By maintaining an active, structured watchlist, you position yourself to act decisively when value emerges—before the rest of your league wakes up.

### 1.4.5 – Mock Drafting & Scenario Testing

Mock drafting isn’t a warm-up—it’s data mining. Every mock you run is a controlled experiment that reveals how ADPs shift, where positional cliffs appear, and what draft slot trends dominate your format.

Too many managers run mocks just to feel confident. Great players use them to map probability spaces, prepare for chaos, and **practice discipline under pressure**.

---

#### 🎯 Why Mock Draft?

| Objective                      | Benefit                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Practice ADP-based decisions  | Simulates likely choices in real-time        |
| Test roster constructions     | Stars/scrubs, balanced builds, positional early |
| Study draft flow by position  | Know when positional runs typically hit      |
| Reaction drills               | Prepare for “sniped” picks or strategy pivots |

---

#### 🔁 Mock Draft Formats

| Format        | Use Case                                   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Live Mock     | Real-time practice against other users     |
| CPU Sim       | Fast reps to test structure and reach      |
| Expert Drafts | Replay historical expert mock data         |
| Custom Room   | Replicate your exact league settings       |

> Use FantasyPros, Sleeper, ESPN Draft Room, or Underdog as sandbox tools.

---

#### 🧠 Core Mock Strategy Scenarios

1. **Zero-RB Start**
   - Go WR/WR/WR or WR/TE and wait on RB depth
   - Great for PPR leagues with deep RB sleeper pools

2. **Hero-RB Strategy**
   - Anchor one elite RB early, then hammer WR/TE/QB
   - Balances floor with upside

3. **Tight End Early**
   - Draft Kelce/Andrews/Pitts in Rounds 1–3
   - Test WR/RB depth options if you spend early

4. **Late-QB or QB-Early Builds**
   - Contrast Josh Allen at 3.01 vs. Cousins at 9.10
   - What are you giving up for early QB stability?

---

#### 🧮 Scenario Planner Formula

Use this model to simulate impact of early-round decisions:

```
Team Score = (Top 3 Player Value × 1.5) + (Mid-Tier Upside × 1.2) + (Depth × 1.0)
```

Plug in projected point values or VORP to test theoretical builds. Compare across multiple mocks.

---

#### 📊 Mock Draft Tracker (Recommended Table)

| Mock # | Format | Draft Slot | Strategy       | Pos. Rostered | Final Grade | Pain Point         |
|--------|--------|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| #1     | PPR    | 1.06       | Zero-RB        | 2RB, 4WR, 1TE  | B           | RB floor thin       |
| #2     | Superflex | 1.03     | QB-QB Early    | 2QB, 3RB, 3WR  | A-          | WR depth weak       |
| #3     | Roto   | 1.10       | Balanced        | 3SP, 3OF, 1C   | A           | No elite closer     |

Track 5–10 mocks before draft day. Adjust tier board based on results.

---

#### 💡 Scenario Testing Drill

Run “worst case” mocks from different draft slots:

- Get sniped 1–2 rounds in a row
- Miss all Tier 1 RBs by early Round 2
- TE run hits before your pick
- High-volume WRs all gone by Round 5

How do you adapt? What positions can you pivot into? This is how you train for real-draft chaos.

---

#### 📋 Mock Draft Commandments

1. **Mock with your league’s scoring and roster settings**
2. **Avoid groupthink—test your own rankings**
3. **Record results and analyze the gaps**
4. **Don’t autopick or leave mid-draft—you learn nothing**

- **ADP Trends Charts** – Understand late risers and fallers  
- **Scoring System Simulators** – Build projections based on your league format  
- **Google Sheets Draft Kit** – Color-coded tiers, filters, projections  

---

### 💡 Bonus Formula: Roster Value Projection

Estimate your expected value per starting slot with this quick model:

```text
Expected Roster Value = ∑(Player Projected Points × Positional Scarcity Multiplier)

Where:
- Player Projected Points = fantasy points projected for each player
- Positional Scarcity Multiplier = weight that reflects positional depth/value
    - QB: 1.0
    - TE: 1.3 (e.g., few elite options)
    - RP (baseball): 1.5
    - FLEX: 0.9
```



This gives you a way to measure positional impact while balancing your team build.

⚠️ Common Draft Pitfalls to Avoid


Mistake	Why It Hurts	Fix

Drafting Based on Name Value
Old reputations ≠ future production	
Trust projections and role clarity

Forgetting Bye Weeks	
Creates dead weeks in season
Build a bye calendar (auto-sorted sheet)

Fading Injury Risk Too Much	
Risk is real, but so is value at a discount	Price in the risk — don’t avoid entirely

Reaching for “Your Guy” Too Early	
Hurts team balance and positional value	Have tiers ready, know market prices



---

🎯 Final Prep Before Draft Day

- ☐ League scoring and settings reviewed
- ☐ Draft kit loaded (sheets, app, browser tabs)
- ☐ Backup internet plan confirmed
- ☐ Target tiers and watchlists updated
- ☐ Group chat or Discord open for banter (optional)
- ☐ Cold drink or coffee ready


> 🧠 Remember: You don’t win your league at the draft — but you can lose it there. Show up sharp.

Certainly! Here's Section 1.4.7 – Draft Psychology & Game Theory in Markdown format directly on screen:

## 1.4.7 – Draft Psychology & Game Theory

### 🎭 Draft Rooms Are Not Rational

The biggest edge in fantasy drafts often isn’t found in the rankings — it’s in **understanding how people behave under pressure**. Most managers don’t draft based on pure projections or tier logic. They draft based on emotion, bias, FOMO (fear of missing out), and streaks of overconfidence.

Welcome to the intersection of **behavioral economics**, **game theory**, and **trash talk**.

To win drafts, you must think in **patterns, incentives, and probabilities** — not just rankings. Knowing when to exploit groupthink, when to induce panic picks, and when to zig while others zag can swing an entire season before Week 1.

---

### 🧠 Core Concepts in Draft Psychology

#### 1. Recency Bias
Players who performed well at the end of last season or in the playoffs often get overdrafted. Similarly, players who disappointed are faded too far.

> Example: A RB with two 100-yard games in Weeks 16–17 might jump 30+ ADP spots due to championship memories — even if their role hasn’t changed.

**Counter:** Zoom out. Use full-season metrics and situation-adjusted data. One hot week does not a breakout make.

#### 2. Loss Aversion
People fear losing more than they value winning. In drafts, this shows up as:
- Hesitation to take high-risk/high-reward players
- Over-drafting "safe" veterans
- Avoiding injury-prone players even at value

**Exploit it:** Be willing to draft volatility in the mid/late rounds — where ceiling matters more than floor.

#### 3. ADP Anchoring
Average Draft Position becomes a mental anchor. Players outside the ADP range are perceived as "reaches," even when they’re properly valued.

**Exploit it:** If you value a player above consensus, don’t wait. Take your guy. Let others cling to consensus.

### 🔁 Game Theory in Action

Fantasy drafts are multi-player games where each pick alters the board. The goal isn’t just to build a good team — it’s to do so more efficiently than everyone else.

> “Game theory isn't about predicting what the board will do — it's about profiting from how others play it wrong.”

|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Tier Gapping          | Forcing others into poor-value zones| Skip a tier to let positional cliffs drop    |
| Positional Leverage   | Exploiting runs or avoiding traps   | Draft TE early if top 3 are elite, or fade  |
| Roster Mirroring      | Copying structure to block leverage | Prevent exploitative trades                  |
| Reach-to-Block        | Prevents opponent stacks/handcuffs  | Snipe key pairing if it hurts opponent more  |

#### Know These Player Types

| Draft Archetype     | Traits                                        | Weaknesses to Exploit           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| The Homer           | Overdrafts players from favorite team         | Fade their team, steal value    |
| The Magazine Guy    | Uses outdated info                            | Snipe modern breakout picks     |
| The Safe Drafter    | Picks old names, avoids upside                | Hammer mid-round sleepers       |
| The Impulse Picker  | Follows noise, draft chat                     | Create fake runs                |

### 🧠 Draft Table Tactics

#### 🧨 Create Psychological Pressure

1. **Start a Positional Run**
   - Drafting the first D/ST early can spark a wave.
2. **Talk Up a Sleeper**
   - Mentioning “I hope no one takes Skyy Moore” might get him drafted.
3. **Feign Disinterest**
   - Say you’re avoiding injured players, then draft them at value.

> Fantasy drafts are social. Use language and tone as tools.

---

### 📊 Game Theory Formula: Marginal Positional Value

```
MPV = (Your Positional Score – League Avg Positional Score) / Positional Std Dev

Where:

Your Positional Score = Projected points at a position

League Avg = Average points for all starters at that position

Positional Std Dev = Spread of points among all starters
```

Use this to calculate positional advantage.

---

📦 Draft Day Bluffing & Signaling

Like poker, fantasy drafts include signaling — whether intentional or not.

Picking slow = indecisive

Stacking early = telegraphs strategy

Drafting same position repeatedly = build signal


You’re not just drafting players — you’re drafting behavior.

🧠 Bias-Aware Drafting Framework

Bias Type	Typical Effect	Correction Tactic

Recency Bias	Overrates late-season surge	Use full-year + situation data
Anchoring	ADP becomes gospel	Create your own tier board
Confirmation Bias	Ignores contradicting evidence	Read opposing scouting reports
Availability	Picks only memorable names	Cross-check with projections

💬 Real-World Application

In a 12-team PPR league, I knew three drafters always stacked RBs early. I went WR-WR-TE and waited on RB. By Round 6, I drafted Rachaad White — not because I loved him, but because others had to chase the WRs I already controlled.

> Game theory isn’t about getting “your guys.” It’s about building value from the table’s mistakes.

Great — here is the "Roster Construction" section from 1.4 in full Markdown format, ready for use:

## 1.4.8 🧱 Roster Construction

Winning rosters have **balance**, **depth**, and **ceiling**. The best managers don’t just fill starting spots—they build toward both stability and upside.

A friend of mine once drafted nothing but boom-or-bust players. By midseason, he was either scoring 200+ or 80 in weekly matchups. He missed playoffs by one game—proving that high ceiling alone doesn’t win championships.

### 🧩 Core Archetypes

| Build Style    | Traits                                    | Risk | Ceiling   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---- | --------- |
| Stars & Scrubs | Elite players + dart throws               | High | High      |
| Balanced       | Equal production across all starters      | Low  | Medium    |
| Upside Hoard   | Targets rookies, sleepers, and volatility | High | Very High |

> 🎯 Draft for ceiling early, floor late.

### 🔁 Real-Life Example

In baseball, if you draft early-round SPs like Gerrit Cole and Spencer Strider, you can wait on bats and load up on high-floor hitters later like Brandon Nimmo or Thairo Estrada.

### 📊 Positional Allocation Grid (Example – 1QB PPR Football)

| Position | Starters | Bench Targets | Notes                                |
| -------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| QB       | 1        | 1              | Late-round QB value exists           |
| RB       | 2        | 3–4            | Depth wins; handcuffs recommended    |
| WR       | 3        | 3–5            | Flex upside; stream options weekly   |
| TE       | 1        | 1              | Elite or stream—no in-between        |
| DST      | 1        | 0              | Stream based on matchups             |
| K        | 1        | 0              | Replaceable; late-round or waiver    |

### 🧠 Construction Guidelines by Format

#### 📆 Redraft:
- Prioritize safe floors early.
- Build around high-usage, high-volume roles.
- Plan 2–3 week streaming flexibility into bench spots.

#### 🧪 Dynasty:
- Depth > top-heavy builds.
- Age curves and positional shelf life matter.
- Handcuff youth with aging veterans for stability.

#### 💥 Best Ball:
- No waivers = draft for injuries/spike weeks.
- 2+ QBs, 2–3 TEs recommended.
- Stack WR/TE with QBs for upside correlation.

#### 🧠 Formula: Roster Strength Quotient 

```
(RSQ)
RSQ = (Starter Average × 0.6) + (Bench Average × 0.3) + (Ceiling Coefficient × 0.1)

Where:
- Starter Average = average projected points for starting lineup
- Bench Average = average of top 3 bench players
- Ceiling Coefficient = # of players with 90th percentile weekly upside
```

### 🔧 Tips to Build for Flexibility

- Draft multi-position eligible players in baseball/basketball.
- Choose WRs/RBs with return/kick duties (dual value).
- Track playoff schedules before final rounds (Weeks 14–17 matter).

---

### ❌ Avoid These Roster Construction Mistakes

- Overstacking bye weeks (e.g., 4 WRs off in Week 7).
- Drafting “name value” without defined role.
- Ignoring positional drop-offs (especially TE and RP).

---

> 🧠 Final Thought: Your roster should have answers to 3 questions:
> 1. Who carries my team early?
> 2. Who breaks out in midseason?
> 3. Who do I trust in the playoffs?

🧠 Final Takeaway

Fantasy drafting is 50% planning and 50% psychology. Don’t just draft players — draft the room.
