### 🎯 *How Format Dictates Your Draft Plan, Round by Round*

---

## 🧠 The Golden Rule: Format Changes Everything

No two fantasy formats reward the same draft approach. A roster built for rotisserie will flop in head-to-head. A team made for best ball will crash in a points league. That’s why the first rule of draft prep is this:

> **Your format defines your edge. Learn it. Draft for it. Win because of it.**

In this chapter, we’ll break down the strategic blueprint for each major format. You’ll also find example rosters, draft board math, positional breakdowns, and how to leverage scoring quirks.

## 🧩 Key Draft Concepts (Works Across All Formats)

| Term                    | Meaning                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ADP**                 | Average Draft Position across platforms (Yahoo, ESPN, Sleeper, etc.) |
| **VORP**                | Value Over Replacement Player – surplus value vs. baseline           |
| **Tiering**             | Grouping players into performance clusters, not rigid ranks          |
| **Positional Scarcity** | Recognizing thin positions where early picks yield long-term edge    |
| **Roster Construction** | The balance of positions, upside, and risk across your team          |

🛠 Use these tools to evaluate players *relative* to league settings — not just rankings.

## 🔄 Redraft League Strategy

### 🎯 Goal: Win Now

* **Early Rounds:** Focus on reliability, high floor + high usage (volume wins)
* **Mid Rounds:** Draft upside with league-winning potential (breakout candidates)
* **Late Rounds:** Lottery tickets, handcuffs, rookies, streaming potential

📊 *Formula:*
**Team Value = (Top 3 Picks × 1.5) + (Breakout Hits × 2.0) + Waiver Wins × 3.0**

✅ **Draft Day Tips:**

* Fade injury-prone players early unless the upside is massive.
* Stack WRs in PPR leagues.
* Target a QB in Rounds 6–9 unless elite tier falls.

🔄 **Streaming Strategy**: Save a bench spot for rotation (esp. pitchers, TEs, D/ST).

---

## 👑 Dynasty Draft Strategy

### 🎯 Goal: Long-Term Value + Upside

* **Round 1–3:** Anchor players under 27 years old (ideally elite RB/WR/QB)
* **Round 4–8:** Mix of current-year production and breakout-age profiles
* **Round 9–15:** Rookies, depth, stashes, future starters

📊 *Formula:*
**Dynasty Score = (Age Factor × 1.5) + (Expected WAR × 2) + (Contract Horizon)**

🧠 Tips:

* Trade down if your top target is in a large tier.
* Draft positions that age well (WR > RB in longevity).
* Know your rebuild window: win-now or slow build.

## 🪴 Keeper League Strategy

### 🎯 Goal: Draft for Value vs. Cost

* Target undervalued breakouts or rookies in late rounds
* Draft stars at a discount to keep next season (keeper inflation rule applies)

📊 *Example Table: Keeper Cost Matrix*

| Round Drafted | Keeper Cost (Next Year) | Value Grade  |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| Round 10      | Round 8                 | 🔥 Excellent |
| Round 6       | Round 4                 | ✅ Good       |
| Round 2       | Round 1                 | ❌ Risky      |

> *“I drafted Nico Collins in Round 11 and kept him for two years as a Round 9 pick — pure value.”*

🧠 Tip: Avoid overpriced players with short-term hype.

---

## ⚔️ Head-to-Head League Strategy (H2H)

### 🎯 Goal: Beat Matchups Weekly + Make Playoffs

* Emphasize volatility: players who can win a week by themselves
* Stream players with strong weekly schedules
* Punish categories less — punting 1–2 can work

📊 *Streaming Boost Formula:*
**Matchup Edge = (Games Played × Efficiency) × Opponent Weakness Multiplier**

✅ Roster Tips:

* Draft multi-position players (flexibility is power)
* Prioritize playoff schedules for bubble picks

## 📈 Rotisserie (Roto) Draft Strategy

### 🎯 Goal: Balance Across All Categories

* Map category targets per position before the draft
* Avoid punting unless league rules allow strategic tanking
* Scarce categories = draft premium (SBs, Saves, Blocks)

📊 *Category Target Table (Roto Baseball)*

| Stat  | Target (12-team) | Position Anchor |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| HR    | 270–300          | 1B, OF          |
| SB    | 90–110           | SS, OF          |
| Saves | 70–90            | RP              |
| ERA   | < 3.75           | SP              |

🧠 Tip: Use a spreadsheet to update weekly category standings.

---

## 💰 Points League Draft Strategy

### 🎯 Goal: Raw Production > Category Balance

* Project players using platform scoring (Fantrax, Sleeper, Yahoo have different math)
* High-volume, low-risk players are gold
* Streaming is less effective; depth is more important

📊 *Sample QB Formula (Football):*

**Fantasy Points = (Yards × 0.04) + (TD × 6) – (INT × 2)**

✅ Draft Notes:

* Fade gadget players and boom/bust WRs
* RBs with pass-catching roles get a boost
* Rushing QBs rise fast

---

## 💥 Best Ball Strategy

### 🎯 Goal: Maximize Spike Weeks

* Stack QBs with WR/TE teammates
* Avoid players with low weekly ceilings
* Draft depth — no waivers or trades

📊 *Optimal Draft Formula:*
**Best Ball ROI = (Spike Weeks × Positional Replacement Value) / Draft Capital**

🧠 Best Ball Stack Table:

| QB      | WR Stack Target | Late Round Add |
| ------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Mahomes | Rashee Rice     | Noah Gray      |
| Hurts   | DeVonta Smith   | Quez Watkins   |
| Love    | Doubs, Reed     | Musgrave       |

---

## 🔐 Bonus: Auction Draft Strategy

### 🎯 Goal: Maximize Dollar Efficiency

* Assign dollar values to all players using projection-based calculators
* Nominate high-cost players early to drain budgets
* Wait on tight ends and QBs unless it’s a superflex format

📊 *Auction Value Equation:*
**Value = (Projected Points – Baseline) × \$/Point Multiplier**

🧠 Tip: Budget 70% of your money on top 4 players, 30% on bench depth.

---

## ✅ Final Draft Checklist (Any Format)

1. 📘 Know your format (PPR, 2QB, roto, points?)
2. 🧠 Build a tiered draft board (not linear ranks)
3. 📊 Use projections + scoring-specific calculators
4. 🧩 Plan positional construction before the draft
5. 🔁 Have backup plans for sniped players
6. 🎯 Execute your build — stars/scrubs? balanced? value stack?
7. 📆 Study playoff schedules + bye weeks (especially in H2H)
8. 💼 Draft for the format you’re in — not the one you like most
