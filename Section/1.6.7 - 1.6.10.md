Here is the updated and expanded Section 1.6.7 ‚Äì Multi-Sport and Niche Platforms, formatted in Markdown:

## 1.6.7 ‚Äì Multi-Sport and Niche Platforms

Some of the most interesting fantasy ecosystems live outside the mainstream platforms. Whether you're looking for extreme customization, multi-league combinations, or unique contest structures, niche and specialized platforms cater to players who want more control‚Äîor more chaos.

### üß© Multi-Sport Fantasy Platforms

These platforms combine multiple sports (e.g., NFL + NBA + MLB) into a single meta-league.

#### üîÑ How They Work
- Managers build rosters across several sports.
- Points or standings accumulate across overlapping or consecutive seasons.
- Often use auction or dynasty frameworks to keep things balanced.

#### üí° Example Formats
| Platform       | Structure Type      | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Ottoneu        | MLB + Soccer        | Advanced economics-style keeper systems |
| Fantrax Custom | MLB + NBA + NFL     | League admins define structure; spreadsheet tracking often required |
| Sleeper (limited) | Some crossover support | Mostly seasonal but flexible draft tools |

> Multi-sport leagues reward year-round engagement and long-view roster vision.

### üéØ Niche Fantasy Formats

Outside of standard leagues, alternative formats like Pick‚Äôems, Brackets, Survivor pools, and Prop-Based games offer lighter, faster, or more casual experiences.

#### ‚úÖ Pick‚Äôem Contests
- Users choose between player A vs. player B, or ‚ÄúOver/Under‚Äù stat projections.
- Often run weekly or daily.
- Used heavily in DFS or sports betting crossover environments.

#### üé≤ Survivor Leagues
- You pick one team to win each week.
- Once picked, that team can‚Äôt be reused.
- Eliminated if your pick loses.
- Often has large payouts and massive weekly attrition.

#### üß† Bracket Leagues
- Seasonal or event-based (e.g., March Madness, NFL Playoffs).
- Pick results for playoff outcomes round by round.
- Points increase with round depth or upset predictions.

#### üìä Prop-Based Fantasy
- Instead of drafting rosters, users pick stat props for players (e.g., ‚ÄúWill Josh Allen throw 3+ TDs?‚Äù).
- Used in hybrid fantasy-sportsbook environments.
- Great for casual players or cross-promotional contests.

| Format Type        | Skill Level     | Time Commitment | Risk Style     | Common Platforms          |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Pick‚Äôem            | Medium           | Low to Medium    | Moderate       | Underdog, PrizePicks      |
| Survivor           | Medium           | Low              | High (elimination) | ESPN, Yahoo, RunYourPool |
| Bracket            | Low              | Low              | Low to Moderate| ESPN, CBS, custom sheets  |
| Prop-Based Fantasy | Low to Medium    | Daily            | High           | Sleeper Picks, FanDuel, DK|

> These formats are especially appealing to casual users, sports bettors, and mobile-first audiences.

### üß∞ When to Use Niche or Hybrid Formats

| Use Case                                    | Recommended Format                |

| Friends looking for a fast and fun league  | Pick‚Äôem or Bracket Challenges     |

| High-stakes seasonal players               | Multi-sport custom platforms      |
| DFS players wanting season-long feel       | Best Ball or Prop-Based           |
| Crossover bettors/fantasy hybrid players   | Over/Under + Pick‚Äôem platforms    |

## 1.6.8 ‚Äì Tools Embedded in Platforms

Modern fantasy platforms aren't just draft boards and score trackers‚Äîthey‚Äôre evolving ecosystems packed with built-in tools designed to help you make smarter decisions, faster. From waiver suggestions to start/sit projections, many platforms now blur the line between hosting and coaching.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Embedded Tools

| Tool Type              | Common Features                                     | Platforms Offering It             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Player News & Alerts**  | Injury updates, trade alerts, lineup status         | ESPN, Yahoo, Sleeper, CBS         |
| **Start/Sit Recommendations** | Weekly projections based on matchup & roster data | Yahoo, NFL.com, FantasyPros sync  |

### üîÑ Real-Time Sync Features

| Feature                     | Description                                          | Platforms              |

### üìà Why These Tools Matter

Built-in tools help reduce mental overhead and surface key edges‚Äîespecially useful for:

- **Multi-league managers** juggling dozens of rosters
- **Beginner users** unfamiliar with value-based drafting or FAAB bidding
- **Time-strapped players** relying on weekly autopilot features

These embedded systems are best used as **supporting tools**, not crutches. Smart players cross-reference them against projections, player usage reports, and their own instincts.

### üìå Quick Tip

> Combine embedded tools with manual prep:
> Use platform start/sit tools ‚Üí check snap counts & game scripts ‚Üí then make your final decision.

## 1.6.9 ‚Äì Platform Scoring Nuances to Watch For

Scoring systems are the skeleton of every fantasy platform‚Äîand while league commissioners can usually customize settings, default scoring often varies drastically between platforms. These differences can make or break player value, roster construction, and even draft strategy.

---

### üßÆ Common Default Scoring Discrepancies

| Stat Category             | Yahoo                  | ESPN                   | Sleeper               | CBS                    |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Passing TD               | 4 pts                  | 4 pts                  | 6 pts (editable)      | 6 pts                  |
| Reception (PPR)          | Half-PPR               | Full PPR               | Full PPR              | Half-PPR               |
| Negative Points for INT  | -1                     | -2                     | -2                    | -2                     |
| Bonus Points (e.g. 100 yds rushing) | None by default     | Often included         | Optional              | Often included         |
| Sack Scoring (DST)       | 1 pt                   | 1 pt                   | 1 pt                  | 2 pts (some defaults)  |

> üéØ Always check the default settings before joining a league‚Äîeven public ones.

---

### üîç Where Nuances Matter Most

1. **Quarterback Value**
   - 4 vs 6 point passing TDs dramatically alter QB rankings.
   - Platforms with 6-pt TDs push QBs up draft boards.

2. **Receiving Work**
   - Full PPR vs Half-PPR changes RB rankings heavily.
   - Pass-catching RBs (e.g., Ekeler, Rachaad White) gain more value in full PPR.

3. **Defense & Special Teams (DST)**
   - Some platforms overvalue DSTs (e.g., 2 pts per sack, +10 for shutouts).
   - Others include yardage allowed tiers or INT/TD return bonuses.

4. **Bonus Scoring**
   - Platforms like CBS and ESPN often include milestone bonuses:
     - 100+ yard rushing/receiving
     - 40+ yard TDs
   - These add volatility and favor explosive playmakers.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Example: Same Player, Different Platform

Let‚Äôs take a wide receiver who posts:

- 6 catches
- 90 yards
- 1 TD

| Platform  | Points Scored | Why?                                     |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| ESPN      | 21.0          | Full PPR (6) + 9 (yards) + 6 (TD)        |
| Yahoo     | 19.0          | Half-PPR (3) + 9 (yards) + 6 (TD)        |
| CBS       | 24.0          | Same as Yahoo + 3 pt bonus for 100-yard game |
| Sleeper   | 21.0          | Full PPR, same base scoring              |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Hidden Traps to Avoid

- **Joining blind leagues** without checking the rulebook.
- **Assuming standard settings** when there is no real ‚Äústandard.‚Äù
- **Overdrafting** DSTs or Kickers based on inflated scoring defaults.

---

### üß† Pro Tip

> Always import scoring settings into your rankings tool or projections calculator.
> One scoring wrinkle can shift a player 2+ rounds up or down.

---

### üìå Final Tip

If you're in multiple leagues, consider using a platform scoring comparison sheet. Knowing the scoring quirks will give you a consistent edge in draft value, weekly lineup decisions, and trade negotiations.
